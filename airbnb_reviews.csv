390395,Lauren,5,Seanâ€™s place was fantastic. Highly recommend!!
390395,Christina,5,Seanâ€™s place is very comfortable and cute. Sean was super accommodating and welcoming- definitely recommend his place!
390395,Hattie,5,"Sean was a great host. Super friendly and accommodating. He was full of advice on things to do, places to see and eat. Many thoughtful touches in the apartment for travelers such as lotion, ear plugs, feminine products, etc! Location was in walking distance to Distillery district and the Saint Lawrence market!"
390395,Daniel,5,Super cute bed room. The host answered all questions and messages very quickly. Would recommend!
925491,Vanna,5,Very nice place to stay !  Perfect view !
925491,Trista,5,"I had a wonderful (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication was great, check-in was very easy and the location of the property was perfect for exploring downtown Toronto. I would definitely stay again."
925491,David,5,Me and my girlfriend stayed at Oscars place for 7 nights and let me tell you that the price for this location is hands down unbeatable. You are in between the Scotiabank Arena and CN tower. Walking distance to Union Station for anyone that doesnâ€™t want to drive. The grocery store in the basement of the  high rise (Longoâ€™s) has fantastic hot food during the day. You get a jaw dropping view from the balcony that I enjoyed every night of the city. As far as the apartment itself it was very clean and had a great setup and has all the dish ware and cookware you could ask for. I honestly could not have imagined a more perfect spot for anyone to stay at in the downtown Toronto area. I am so thankful that I found this spot and if this is a spot anyone is considering I have one thing to say...TAKE IT
925491,Katie,5,"Oscarâ€™s was the perfect place to stay for our time in Toronto. We were so close to everything and we could walk to most places. The views from the balcony were amazing too! Instagram worthy! The place was extremely clean, comfortable and check in was easy. Thereâ€™s a grocery store right in the building with a Starbucks too and plenty of restaurants  nearby. Would stay here again next time Iâ€™m in Toronto."
925491,Matthew,5,Great host!!! Would definitely work with this host again in the future.
1066718,Nina,5,"Really enjoyed our stay at Emil's place. A great location with easy access to tons of bars, restaurants, shops, and culture. Plus a lovely outdoor space!"
1066718,Richard,5,A quiet comfy pad. We chose this place for it's location to West side destinations. The patio was a great place to relax between activities. A very nice change from staying downtown.
1066718,Ryan,5,"Emilâ€™s place is exactly as described and in a great location for exploring downtown on foot. The courtyard is particularly lovely. 

Emil himself was friendly and helpful, and so thoughtful! I was in town for my birthday, and arrived home to find a little cake and two candles waiting for me! Such a sweet surprise. 

Great stay in a homey spot!"
1066718,Jen,5,"Donâ€™t pass up this beautiful, tranquil spot that is central to everything yet quiet and relaxing. Emil was an amazing host and welcomed us when we arrived, gave us great tips, then left us to explore and take in beautiful Toronto. Will definitely stay here again when back in the city!"
1066718,Saira,3,Great location. A bit noisy upstairs in the morning and at night for short periods of time when the owner is at home.
1080121,Bill,5,Itâ€™s a perfect location. Book now!
1080121,Jr,5,"Katyâ€™s place was perfectly located to Union Station and the convention center. The building and apartment are modern, clean, safe and quiet. View was amazing."
1080121,Korey,5,"Katyâ€™s condo was everything that I expected. The photos are a great image of what to expect.  The view was stunning and location was excellent. She was also quick to respond when I had a question, would certainly recommend and stay again."
1080121,Edwin,5,"Awesome place. Great location, right in the middle of the action. Katy is super organized and her instructions were easy to follow."
1080121,Melissa,4,Itâ€™s all about the views with this space. Morning and evening do not disappoint with the harbor views. Tons of restaurants and shops near by. Easy to get around the city from this location.
1382277,Nicalena,5,Cristinaâ€™s place was in an amazing location. Easy to navigate the neighborhood. Beautiful apartment loft and building
1382277,Tom,5,"Huge windows, a great kitchen, stylish bathroom, and a cozy sitting area, all within walking distance (depending on the walker) of the downtown area, art museums, restaurants, and more! Go grab some snacks at the St Lawrence Market & relax at home after a long day of sightseeing with netflix and a glass of wine."
1382277,Terra,5,"Cristina was very warm and welcoming, and accommodating to our late check-in. She suggested some great local places to check out, and took the time to show me around the space. The apartment is beautiful and comfortable. The murphy bed is also wonderful to sleep in. The space had everything we needed, was very quiet, and was very close to some great spots in Toronto. I hope to stay again in the future!"
1382277,Debbie,5,"Cristina's air B&B was so conveniently located and within easy walking distance of the Distillery district and St Lawrence Market, as well as many places to enjoy a fine dinner.  The amenities she provided were wonderful and the place was super clean."
1382277,Kelly,5,"A beautiful studio with a comfortable bed, interesting and modern, yet totally cozy interior design. The artwork and indoor plants brighten the place up, along with floor to ceiling windows. The blinds, appliances, and television were easy to control. Walkable to the distillery district and Queen St East, and a short Uber to downtown, the harbor, or west side of Toronto! Cristina recommended El CantÃ­n for dinner, and it was one of the best dining experiences weâ€™ve had! Free parking is always on our must-have list, and it was easy enough to get a pass from security and keep the car safe in a lot right outside the building. It also has all the essentials for coffee and cooking, which we enjoyed. Overall a great stay for a few nights! Thank you!"
1989937,Brandon,5,The apartment was very clean and also modern. Great location and even better restaurants near by! Would deff recommend!
1989937,Brandi,5,We absolutely love this place! It is in great proximity to downtown and many restaurants. Everything is pretty much in walking distance and the space is very stylish and modern. We definitely plan to stay here again!
1989937,Michelle,5,Clean and trendy place to stay.  Lots of good restaurants within walking distance.  Host was prompt to respond to any questions.  Highly recommend.
1989937,Michael,4,"Beautiful and stylish space, a very comfortable place to stay, in a very lively and active neighborhood."
1989937,Suzanne,4,"Great location and very very clean. Beautiful place to stay easy to get around. Bathroom and kitchen are spacious and have everything you could need. Nothing really bad to say, but I wouldnâ€™t suggest booking the space for more than 2-3 people, the sofa beds are not too comfy."
2078597,Ato,5,An excellent apartment in a very handy location of Toronto. The place was super clean and stylishly decorates. And kate was very easy to reach at all times. I will definitely live here again whenever I am in Toronto.
2078597,Larisse,5,"We loved it!  Location, comfort and amenities were great!  The space was inviting and clean.  Kate and Mike were very responsive and easy to communicate with!  We would not hesitate to book again!"
2078597,Anne,5,"A beautiful apartment in a very walker-friendly location.  Thoughtfully and comfortably decorated with the bonus of interesting, and often whimsical artwork.  The kitchen was especially appreciated--light and airy and completely outfitted with everything you'd need for meals ""at home."""
2078597,Tatjana,5,"Let me start by saying that this a very cosy, modern apartment with touch for details, fully equipped, located close to many restaurants, grocery stores. Communication with the host was exceptional and easy. We used a parking lot that was available for us. I would highly recomend Kate's place!"
2078597,Erik,5,"Very lovely accommodation in a neighborhood close to all things Toronto.  For anyone looking to get outdoors it's very close to Hyde Park, waterfront, and more.  Apartment is cozy and quiet.  All the amenities are up to date.  Many thanks to the hosts for a pleasant stay!"
2666562,Sheridan,5,Wonderful home and the owners are sweet folk. In a very calm quiet neighborhood.
2666562,Andrew,5,Clean space. Host was super timely in replying to us. Free parking and swimming pool is a plus
2666562,Delores,5,"Great place, I would definitely come back and recommend this place to my friends."
2666562,Lisa,5,This was my first time with AirBNB and if this is the quality of AirBNB I will never stay in a hotel again. Thank you Paul and Lena
2666562,Eva,5,"This was a great spot to stay during our visit to Toronto. We drove out there from Chicago and Lina was great at keeping in touch. She also made checking in super easy and gave us helpful information. The appartment is cozy, you have everything you need and it was a 30 min drive (more or less depending on traffic) to the entertainment district. It's also close to other attractions and grocery stores if you cook (we loved metro, it's similar to a Mariano's). Overall, we had a great experience."
3433630,Jieling,5,Harry is the best host Iâ€™ve ever met! His house is clean and comfortable - will def book again
3433630,Joe,5,Spotlessly clean in a quiet neighborhood. Harry was thorough regarding any and all information you could think of for the duration of my stay. 10/10 would recommend and/or stay again.
3433630,Christine,5,"Harry's place is very comfortable and clean.  I've stayed three times and used two of the rooms - third floor is my preference because the bathroom is roomier.  It is a shared bathroom, which didn't affect my stay at all.  The house is easy to get to and within easy walking distance of Scotiabank arena, St Lawrence Market, and Distillery District.  Also many nice shops and restaurants.  Parking is easy - just pop online - Harry will send you the site - and print your parking pass before you head to Toronto.  
Last but not least Harry is very warm and welcoming.  Great Host!!!
Highly recommend this Airbnb!!"
3433630,Ting,5,"Beautiful space, personable host. Would definitely book this place again if I return!"
3433630,Genevieve,5,"I would definitely recommend Harry's place at anytime, he was a great host and very welcoming. I truly enjoyed my stay."
3464606,Andrew,5,"The bedroom is beautiful, clean, and in a great location. Harry included a bunch of nice touches that made our stay a breeze!"
3464606,Mushtaba,5,An amazing stay. This was by far one of my best Airbnb stays ever. Harry is amazing. Check in process is seamless as well as checking out. The place is super clean and comfy. If I went back to Toronto Iâ€™d stay there again. Thanks Harry!!
3464606,Hanna,5,Harry's place is great! The bed is super comfortable and its quiet for being right in the city. Super easy check in and great host! I will be back.
3464606,Shirley,5,"The room was even better than pictured, clean, beautifully appointed, and well designed.  I particularly enjoyed the private en-suite bathroom, super convenient.

The check-in process was super smooth and communication were prompt and clear.  I loved the little note at my room door that welcomed me.

I also had the pleasure of meeting Harry and having an hour+ conversation with him, I just wish I had more time to hear all his incredible+interesting life stories.

When I come back to Toronto next time Iâ€™m definitely staying at Harryâ€™s and definitely for longer than a night (:

He desertall the superb reviews he has!"
3464606,Tifanne,5,I loves staying at Harry's.  Very quiet and clean with all the amenities you'd get a hotel and better.  The location was in perfect walking distance to a lot.  I felt safe.
3942993,Kristyn,5,Cozy unit in a great location! Parking on site and a park across the street. Able to walk everywhere! Would stay here again
3942993,Joann,5,Josephâ€™s place was great! It was very neat and clean and he helped sort out any problem we had! Would stay again if Iâ€™m ever back in Toronto!
3942993,Brianne,4,The location is great and the apartment is well appointed. The best was comfortable and the wifi was fast. Check in was easy with the lock box and their is convenient parking for $10/day behind the place if you drive in. I will say that the place is directly above a nightclub/bar which plays music until 2am. They are supposed to turn it off at 11pm but they did not. There is no counter in the bathroom to put your items on while getting ready but there is a big full length mirror in the spacious bedroom/living room that you can use to dry your hair or put on makeup. We did not use the kitchen so I can't speak to that aspect of the place. We went for a wedding and the venue was right around the corner so it was very convenient for us. It is centrally located and near lots of really great restaurants. We did have a chance to go to the Royal Ontario Museum and it was about 12 minutes by Lyft. Aside from the loud club underneath I would stay again.
3942993,Kristin,4,Great location. But be forewarned: the apartment is atop a bar/club. Loud music quite audible through the floor played till midnight on Thursday and 2 pm on Friday. A good set of earplugs is recommended.
3942993,Amanda,4,"This is a nice place! We enjoyed the view of the city outside our window. We struggled a bit as people coming from out-of-town to figure out parking downtown, the bathroom is a bit small, and the bar right below sometimes plays loud music well past midnight, but it was a decent space in a good location for getting to a lot of fun places in Toronto. Thank you Joseph!"
3950747,Alan,5,"Exceptional experience. Everything as described, very clean. Excellent location; couple blocks to Distillery district, easy walk to Union station and downtown. Harry was very responsive, and a perfect host. He even had suggestion for a walking route around town. Would definitely recommend to friends, and will stay again."
3950747,Damian,5,"Harryâ€™s house is wonderful, very clean in a perfect location. As a person he is awesome and friendly. 100% recommended"
3950747,Yuyan,5,"We had a very smooth stay. Harry is definitely a wonderful host, who also keeps everything clean and organized. He's helpful and considerate, he responded quickly too. If the bathroom pipes were quieter, this place would be more than perfect."
3950747,Jacie,5,"Thanks for everything Harry! We enjoyed our time in Toronto! Great local tips on where/what to do. Maybe need just a small trash in the room but otherwise, Great!"
3950747,Beth,4,"Harryâ€™s place is a chic urban townhouse. Lovely and immaculate, great location. The stairs are quite steep if you have heavy luggage and I had a snafu with technology and the heating system. Harry was very responsive."
3987246,Hamid,5,It was perfect .
3987246,Dan,5,"Elaine and Greg were a great host. I'd recommend anyone wanting to explore downtown Toronto to try out their place. Its next great restaurants as well as being located at a safe location. I enjoyed my stay while at their place. Try it out, you'll love the cleanliness, privacy, and most of all, the comfort."
3987246,Deshawna,5,Good location from everything you may want to see
3987246,Luis,4,"Great place for last min booking, thatâ€™s what I did since my flight got cancelled"
3987246,Keith,3,"Cool part of town, near the Distillery District."
3994370,Becky,5,This is a wonderful hostel-like home that was clean and beautiful. Elaine was a wonderful host.
3994370,Jessica,5,Awesome people. Elaine was very nice and thoughtful.
3994370,Omaya,5,Elaine and Greg have a very nice place. It is clean and easy to get in and out. I like the shared room because I am a solo traveler and itâ€™s nice to get to know new people.
3994370,Joyce,4,"Elaine & Greg, were truly amazing! My stay was a lot better than i had anticipated. Mainly because Iâ€™ve never gotten a shared Airbnb with strangers before. The experience was very convenient and the ladies who came in and out of the room i shared were all super nice.

I was a bit worried with the whole parking thing, as i had drove my car to Toronto. However, Elaine has great information regarding the cheap private parking lot. Which was super hassle free once parked. When i had a hard time finding it, she was very patient with directing me on the phone while at work too.

As far as the noise, I expected it to get a bit noisy due to the fact that multiple people live/sleep in the space. All with different sleep / wake times. The noise isnâ€™t obnoxious though, so it wasnâ€™t an issue for me. Falling asleep at night was really easy and waking up as an early riser was also noise free. I hardly noticed there were two other people in my space. 

Anyways, AMAZING place to stay. Itâ€™s super cheap and worth it! This location helped me spend my money on more amazing things for the few days I was there, instead of spending hundreds on a hotel/Airbnb."
3994370,Lenny,4,"If you need to crash for a few hours, this is the right place. Ear plugs recommended."
4198453,Johann,5,"Great place to stay. I would like to start saying that Quinn was really a great host, helping us to find a spot to park our car and flexible with the check in time. The studio is located in a great old-residential neighborhood. It is well equipped for couples or one person, who look for a good place to rest, get a good shower, have a good sleep and eat some easy food before go out. Is really close to the university of Toronto, Casa loma, Yorkville (best spot in town) and Kensington area but you have to walk or Uber your way. Iâ€™m not quite sure about the public transportation in the area. I will stay again for sure."
4198453,Rico,5,Host was very friendly. We are coming back and stay here again
4198453,Laura,5,Great location and communication between us and the host. They helped us secure a parking permit and were really responsive. Highly recommended for folks who wish you use public transport or to walk places!
4198453,Cynthia,4,Great location; close to fantastic restaurants and mass transit
4198453,Natasha,4,"We stayed at Quinn and Chrisâ€™s place for three nights this summer, and here is the list of of pros and cons as they appeared to me. 

Pros: 1.Good location. Most of the places were an easy Uber/Lyft ride away. And we had a very easy and pleasant walk to Kensington market. The neighborhood is lovely too and safe to walk around at night. 
2. Quinn and Chris were very helpful in accommodating our sudden need for a car parking spot. They printed out the permit and had it ready for us almost as soon as we asked. I also found them easier to reach through text messages than over the airbnb app.
3. The space itself is large and roomy though the bathroom is tiny. The kitchen serves well for quick and easy breakfast needs and it was stocked with staples such as butter/sugar/tea/ coffee/ necessary spices and so on. 
Cons: 1. The apartment listing mentions that the ceiling is low and might be a challenge for people who are 6â€™2 and over. However my husband who is a shade under 6ft had to continuously walk with his head bent in the hallway. Plus with the bathroom being small and the ceiling being low , the light there was almost at his temple. And after three days of walking with head tilted sideways he was thoroughly fed up. 
2. Since this is a basement apartment sounds do carry quite a bit from upstairs. 
3. The bedsheets and towels were all cleaned and washed, but bore mild stains from prior usage."
4565516,Matt,5,"Clean space in a great location for business or pleasure in downtown Toronto. Cal & Ali were great hosts who responded quickly, and made sure my stay was a good one."
4565516,Emily,5,Very responsive and in a great location!
4565516,Alessandro,5,Clean and well thought out. Highly recommend staying here!
4565516,Jeff,5,Great location across the street from convention center.  Excellent communication from Cal.   Modern apartment in a modern building.
4565516,Valerie,5,"Cal and Ali's place is very clean, quiet and nice to stay in. Cal is very quick to answer any questions/requests.  There also little details like the fridge full of bootle of water when you arrive which make the trip so much better. The location is amazing."
4828239,Yohanny,5,Place was fire!
4828239,Efrain,5,Great Host and Outstanding place.  Exactly as described and safe location with secure entrance.
4828239,Charlene,5,Very clean and up to date.  Also cozy if I may add
4828239,Bosede,4,"The T.â€™s place is a good and safe place to stay, especially if you are looking for a place closer to most local attractions and restaurants in downtown Toronto. It is close to subway, metro bus and trains station."
4828239,Zach,3,"Great location. Minutes from Union Station, however the check in procedures were inaccurate and confusing but the communication to get it sorted out was great."
4838440,John,5,"Adam is a great host who responded very quickly to our messages. His place is very clean, quiet and comfortable. Great location!"
4838440,Julianne,5,Great location. Perfect for two people. Adam was very quick to respond
4838440,Ti,5,"Place was super clean upon arrival, great location to walk or catch an uber anywhere in the city. Adam was great with communication and quick replies. Highly recommended."
4838440,Csilla,5,Adam is an excellent host who responded to us in a timely manner and answered every single question no matter how minuscule it may have appeared. Fantastic location and amenities nearby! I highly recommend Adam's apartment!
4838440,Ann,5,"â€œLuxuryâ€ is a suitable description for this unit; the building, cleanliness and extra touches throughout were wonderful. Location was great. Host was very responsive. Would definitely stay here again."
4922370,Merrick,5,Had a great time! It was really cool to talk to everyone staying there and the host are very knowledgeable on fun things to do in Toronto! Would stay again!
4922370,Kames,5,Cool spot.
4922370,Chetan,5,"Such. A. Clean. Place. 
Really enjoyed my stay! Wonderful place overall with lots of local tips."
4922370,Julie,4,"Close to Downtown, multiple guests, have to share a bathroom"
4922370,Tianna,3,"Awesome place, the location is a little far from the city but walkable."
5025880,Yonathan,5,"Itâ€™s a great place to stay nice and clean , the owners are friendly and make you feel home I would definitely recommend this place !!"
5025880,Melissa,5,"The place was spotless, the bed was comfortable and there was parking in the driveway so our car was not on the street, property was landscaped beautifully. It was my first Airbnb experience and it was a positive one. The train station was close and our host was helpful about directions etc. we didnâ€™t get to use the pool or the porch because it was cool and we got in late but it was all clean and inviting. Everything was as pictured , no complaints. There was also AC and heat. We used the heater as it did  cool off one night and it worked well to warm the room. No cable tv but WiFi was fine. We did not have laptops to hook up to tv but you could."
5025880,William,5,Close to the Go train and public beaches.Great places to eat near by.Looks as good as the pictures.Great hosts.
5025880,Randi,5,"Peaceful, quiet, clean, and welcoming:  The house has everything you need for an enjoyable stay.   We arrived a little ahead of schedule and Paul and Lina were kind enough to let us check in early.  
The porch just outside is a lovely place to eat meals and we roasted marshmallows in the backyard under the stars.  We swam in the pool and lounged pool side while chatting with and getting to know Paul.  
The house is also a convenient distance from Toronto.  It's a short drive into the city.  But there are parks and beaches nearby as well if you don't want to leave Scarborough."
5025880,Caitlyn,5,Perfect little space for a summer trip in Toronto!
5073623,John,5,"Room is clean. Location is in the heart of Toronto. A quick 10min walk from the train station to the location was perfect, especially since the  train station is the best way to the airport and Niagara Falls!"
5073623,Jen,5,Great location with tons of things to do and explore very close! Had a great time catching amazing live music :)
5073623,Mike,5,"Great value! Right downtown, affordable parking lot. The building is clean and quiet, and there is a surprise jacuzzi tub!"
5073623,Marc,4,It was good but expensive
5073623,James,4,"Good, safe location, easy walk to downtown, clean and bright space. It was pretty noisy at night."
5116831,Sue,5,Large apartment right on Roncesvalles. Very clean and comfortable. Hostess is responsive to the guestâ€™s needs. Have stayed here numerous times.
5116831,Marcus,5,"Cozy AirBnB next to public transit and a sharebike station. I really enjoyed the room itself, though the showers water pressure was kinda weak and the room could get a bit dark in the evening.

Elizabeth herself wasnâ€™t very kind and understanding. I was initially supposed to drive in at 9 pm, but was delayed to 10 pm, and Elizabeth was still there to greet me and check me in.

Note on parking: itâ€™s a bit of a workaround, but I would park in the paid parking lots (free through the night), then use the app to pay for a couple hours in the morning, and then move my car to the side street until I was ready to use it. A bit annoying as the app requires a $20 prepaid, but it was workable."
5116831,Saisha,5,"Met with Elizabeth to check in, she was very pleasant, gave us a ran down of everything. Easy free parking on the nearby streets. Many restaurants and cafes. Close to downtown. Highly recommended."
5116831,Mina,5,Great spot just outside downtown Toronto located near various lines. Elizabeth was so accommodating when we were stuck in traffic for check in and helped us with getting everything in the apartment and covered our parking.
5116831,Brandon,4,"Great neighborhood! Easy to hop on the street car and so many great restaurants and bars in the area! Easy walk to the waterfront, also! Convenient location if you want to stay outside of the city center."
5557092,Karen,5,"Great location, great views"
5557092,Wes,5,Nice apartment with a great view of the city
5557092,Dawn,5,Arrived a bit early to Toronto and wondered about getting to the Airbnb early and the host was very fast to respond to us! We had a great experience and the view was astounding! We loved it there and would definitely come back and stay again!
5557092,Jay,5,This apartment is great and very clean! Exactly as described. Slim is a great host and I would definitely stay here again!
5557092,Rachel,5,"Slims place is perfect for a trip to Toronto. We stayed at Slimâ€™s while in town for a concert and had an easy and quick walk to Scotia bank Arena as well as a 15 minute walk to Queen St W for bar hopping. Parking was easy because of the structure across the street. Starbucks is right next to the front door of the building so itâ€™s perfect to wake up and walk down stairs for a pick me up. And THE VIEW!! Absolutely amazing view. 
The place was clean, modern and in a great location. I would highly recommend staying at Slimâ€™s place for your trip."
5758430,Mary,5,"Fab location, stylish space, good communication from the host. Recommend!"
5758430,Nikki,5,It was pleasure staying at Vinnyâ€™s. He was helpful and communicative and his place was lovely. Highly recommend!
5758430,Scott,5,"Vinny's space was a great location for a great price. Clean, comfortable, and a very smooth, simple check in process. We appreciated the snacks left out for us and the washer/dryer was also handy towards the end of our trip. Overall a great experience! Perfect location for convention center travel."
5758430,Annie,5,"The place is great! It is quiet, gorgeous, and super affordable. I loved the spot, and would have stayed longer if I could! Def. coming back!!!"
5758430,Janet-Jon,5,"When you enter or exit the tall building that houses this apartment, look up! You will be in the immediate shadow of the CN Tower - it is incredibly close! We walked (with luggage) the five or six blocks from/to the Union train station for convenient airport access (UP Express), which normally would be easy without the heavy luggage, or tons of people out on the sidewalks, but with heavy luggage and Friday foot traffic it felt like a much longer walk. We survived and the apartment was worth it! The apartment is super clean, tastefully decorated and comfortably furnished; and it was very quiet and secure when we visited. We would definitely choose to stay there again."
5968455,Sebastiano,5,Great place
5968455,Shiv,5,Great location and wonderful hospitality
5968455,Irina,5,Great place to stay! Peggy and her mom were really knowledgable and kind hosts!

5968455,Roberto,5,"Amazing place affordable and close to everything, clean space definitely recommended :)"
6063858,Angel,5,Great communication and location
6063858,Estefan,5,Clean and comfortable. Excellent location!!
6063858,Shawn,5,"This place is clean, and in a convenient location for tourists. The security team, and host organized everything for me when I arrived. Smooth transaction and I will come here again!"
6063858,John,4,"Overall a good apartment.  Checking in was terrible. Changed the original apartment and parking spot. Parking was in other building and getting luggage up and down was terrible with kids. View, pool and location was amazing."
6214925,Chris,5,"A great place with an easy to reach host. Perfect for my trip. Modern, clean, and a great view."
6214925,Jennifer,5,Very nice listing centrally located I was able to walk everywhere. Easy check in and very clean.
6214925,Pablo,5,"The apartment is very  well located, and the view is stunning. It is very clean, and Matt's hospitability is visible from opening the door. A basket of snacks was provided which was very appreciated as I arrived late at night. Access and communication with him were top notch. I very much appreciated his labels providing instructions on how to operate inside. I had no chance to do a trial and error as most of the time we do things as we are used in our house. What we forget is that Airbnb is not a hotel, but someone else's home which is open to us and hence we should treat it as if it was ours. I love the Airbnb community and thanks Matt for opening the doors to me and trusted me."
6214925,Michaela,5,Thank you Matt for a fantastic stay! The condo was in a great location and was clean and comfortable. Matt communicated very promptly to ensure our check in went smoothly. Will definitely visit Toronto again and stay at this Airbnb!! 10/10!
6214925,Pablo,4,I returned to Matt's apartment which now it became my home away from home in Toronto. the view at night is such a bonus- on top of everything else which is top notch!
6406028,Sean,5,Elaine is great!
6406028,Diane,5,"Very conveniently located, wonderful hosts, this is a bustling air bnb with lots of activity. But still, quiet, clean, peaceful, tasteful space with good heat and lovely washroom."
6406028,Mike,5,"Love the location with many places of interest easily walkable. A bonus was being able to meet the hosts--Elaine was kind enough to serve me dinner on my first night. My room was small, but well furnished and comfortable.  Outstanding value for location and amenities."
6406028,Greg,5,"This was my first air bnb stay in a room within a house.  The host were well organized, and the overall stay pleasant.  Good value versus a full service hotel."
6406028,Clarisse,4,I had a great stay at Elaine and Gregâ€™s place. Their place is minutes from the downtown scene.
6504852,Kyra,5,"Marie is wonderful, the place is perfect and I canâ€™t wait to return."
6504852,Jack,5,"This was a glorious place to stay, filled with light and charming touches. Marie is a kind and brilliant host. I would gladly stay again!"
6504852,Mackenzie,5,"A creative and character filled space. Great location! Walkable to restaurants, grocery store, LCBO and distillery district. The space is bright and open and the bed is quite comfy. 

With all of the books on the shelves and the piano it just feels like home."
6504852,J.J.,5,Super cool and cozy place. Marie is nice and easy to reach. Highly recommended :)
6504852,Kip,4,"First, let me say that the host was very communicative, helpful, and responsive - some of the best and clearest host communications I've experienced.   The location was convenient for me, as it is near a business location.   The space was as described - quirky and designer focused.    Bathroom was small but well appointed and clean.   Kitchen is not the best if you plan on doing any extensive cooking - it's functional, but barely.   Bed was extremely comfortable, and entire place, though ""vintage"" in styling, was very clean."
6603099,Roger,5,"Shirin is warm and kind!! The place is cozy and in an amazing location, can get anywhere and in a neat neighborhood. Donâ€™t know why you wouldnâ€™t stay here if you are passing through Torontoâ€” great place to stay."
6603099,Frank,5,"Great price, great location, and great hostess!  If you're travelling by yourself, it's the perfect place to stay while you're in Toronto.  Shirin is a sweetheart and a lovely host!"
6603099,Brian,5,Great location and always very clean. I've stayed here before and will again!
6603099,Allison,5,What a great stay at just the right price!
6603099,Marian,5,Second visit in one month.  Beautiful town house with cute bedroom on third floor.  Immaculately clean.  Fantastic value. Thanks again Shirin!
6957784,Hewad,5,Paul and Shelleys space was great and accurately described. The sauna was a great unique touch
6957784,Nina,5,Shelleyâ€™s place was perfect for our quick weekend away. It was easy to access and a short walk to bars and restaurants. Shelley was quick to respond and very hospitable. We would definitely book again!
6957784,Marta,5,"Location was perfect! Two blocks from Queen St on one side, two blocks from Dundas on the other. Quiet neighborhood feel but next to amazing bars, restaurants and shops.

We had a blast and took full advantage of a sauna room after our mornings or evenings out. The bed was incredibly comfortable and we loved the private feel."
6957784,Colin,5,Very clean and nice studio. It was the perfect place to stay for my girlfriend and I's visit to Toronto. The sauna was a huge bonus to utilize at the end of each long day out and the studio was very private as well. Shelley was an excellent host with very prompt and friendly responses. She definitely made us feel more than welcomed and we have nothing but good things to say about our stay!
6957784,Jessica,3,The location is great. The shower situation is not fantastic.
7027641,Donna,5,"Mohamedâ€™s place has fantastic views!  The unit had everything we needed for our stay. Beds were very comfortable. Loved the location. I mean, you canâ€™t find a better location in Toronto if youâ€™re looking for things to do within walking distance. Lots of great food and pubs!  Close to the waterfront, union station and sporting events. I would definitely recommend checking this one out if you have a stay coming up in Toronto."
7027641,Jessica,5,"This was our second stay with Mohamed and it was as great as the first. The location cannot be beat: a Longos in the same bldg and walking distance to downtown and Old Toronto. I do Airbnbs fairly often and no host has a better response time than Mohamed. I always feel as if I'm relating to a real person. I would definitely rent a third time. The condo is spotless, comfortable and full of amenities, like laundry detergent and spices, oils, for cooking."
7027641,Jamie,5,If you are looking for an amazing condo with amazing views and in the heart of the entertainment district this is your place. :) Amazing place to stay and will be back again.
7027641,Peyman,5,"This is an amazing condo in the best location in the city.  Your are literally across the street from Union station and within walking distance not only to CN tower but also to the pear where you can take the ferry.  The condo has amazing views of the lake and the city.   It was exceptionally clean and stocked with any thing you need. there was even spices if you want to cook.  the attention to detail was amazing and honestly the best condo I have stayed over the world, and I have stayed in many different countries and cities.  Mohammad is extremely helpful and he even helped us jump start our car on the day we were leaving.  I can not say enough good things about this condo and the host."
7027641,Antionette,5,"This location is absolutely amazing! You will love, love the view and amenities. My advice read through all of the check-in instructions you will need them. Overall experience worth every dime."
7047706,Christie,5,Marco was very nice and the place was very clean!
7047706,Sreya,5,Marcos place was close to the city and public transport making it a very convenient place to stay! It was clean  and had everything we needed. Would recommend and would stay again!
7047706,Esteban,5,"Marco was a great host.
Communication was very clear and he was very responsive. He provided great instructions for the check in and the stay at his place.
The bed and pillows were comfortable, and the neighborhood is great.
I would highly recommend staying at Marcoâ€™s place."
7047706,Tereza,5,"I highly recommend this place! Very good location, everything there is nice, clean and easy to learn. Marco is very helpful and nice host!"
7047706,Seth,5,"Marco is a world-class host. He is personable, easy to connect with and communicate with, and very knowledgeable about all things Toronto plus some. Marco made my stay very individualized and not just a ""here are the top-tourist spots in Toronto just do them."" Marco got to know me as soon as I stepped foot in the door. Once he figured out what I liked and didn't like and what I was looking to do or see in Toronto, he hooked me up with a very individualized set of options. His recommendations are sound and he really helps you understand a lot of variety that Toronto has to offer. His personality and intuition is top notch. As for the space, it was tip-top clean. Well-organized, simple space in a quiet neighborhood. Great location for access to the subway! Great space to come back to relax in after a busy day in the city and it even includes a nice back porch! Highly recommend taking advantage of Marco's space if/when it is available, it will be a stay you will never regret!"
7132329,Caroline,5,"Fantastic location, clean and comfortable  apartment and great gym!"
7132329,Lisa,5,This condo was perfect for our trip to Toronto for the 2019 Film Festival.  Very convenient downtown location.
7132329,Douglas,5,"Clean, well equipped, great location.  The condo is well organized, has a nice entertainment system, comfortable bed, and a great view.  It is in a convenient location with many stores and restaurants within a few minutes walk.  The assigned parking in the basement is both convenient and warm if you visit in the winter with easy access to the elevator. Highly recommended."
7132329,Davy,5,Great place with stunning view! Walking up with a cup of coffee and a view of Toronto everyday was a dream.
7132329,Daniel,5,"Simply put, Amad's place is amazing. When I choose to stay somewhere, I'm very methodical in my choices that I make, so I did my research beforehand. All of that lead me to believe that I would not regret booking this place nearly 6 months in advance of my stay.

Overall, the place is just down right nice. No flairs, just everything you want/need. A comfortable and inviting 20th+ floor condo with a stunning view in the heart of a bustling and friendly neighborhood--what else could you ask for?  I can't recommend the spot enough. If you're willing to do a little walking and the weather is nice, this place is accessible to nearly the entire city. My girlfriend and I walked nearly 50 miles over 5 days because we we felt no need to not walk everywhere. 

Amad was great was well. He contacted me immediately after check in to make sure I did not have any trouble and answered the one question I did have during the stay right away. If something did go wrong, I am confident he would have handled it swiftly and without incident. 

I would not hesitate one second booking this place again."
7227180,Jason,5,"Amazing location, clean, safe, a great value."
7227180,Jordyn,4,"A great location! It was right downtown of Yorkville! Almost everything was near us so we could walk! The only thing was when we checked in at the right check-in time, the room was still being cleaned. The sheets and blankets were still wet, so when we went to bed they were freezing cold... Also all the blinds were broken, and we couldnâ€™t get a view of the city, because they wouldnâ€™t go up. The location was the most upside to staying here. It felt like a super safe area with very high class people!"
7227180,Kyle,3,Fair stay. Apartment could have been much more cleanly. Host communicated well and check in process was easy.
7227180,Elizabeth,3,Construction was going on across the window so we did not have the view we anticipated. Very upscale and accessible location.
7227180,Audra,3,"A little bit tricky to find the entrance, and expect to pay a pretty penny if you have to park your car during your stay. We parked ours at the Cumberland Parkade, which was comfortable and convenient. The building felt more like a hotel than a condo apartment building. At one point, a person on the street asked if the entrance was to the hotel she was looking for, and it turned out it was! We arrived an hour after check-in time, and the toilet seat was still wet from having just been cleaned, the laundry had been started and was still running, and wet, washed sheets were hung up to dry in the closet. The aroma of cleaner remained for several days (I am glad things got cleaned, but its' not the most pleasant aroma to be in). The dishwasher was full of dirty dishes, and there was only one cube of dishsoap left. The bathroom had some necessities, but the soap dispenser only had a bit of watered-down, diluted soap in it. Enough to get by, but skimpy. Other toiletries and staples seemed to be leftovers from other guests. Do not expect too many extras, including just enough toilet paper. The host was quick to respond to my questions, which was helpful, and yet this is not a place that has the personal touch that comes from airbnbs where the host lives on site and personally takes care of things. This felt like a building full of numerous airbnb gigs -- a chic neighborhood hotel in which you're left wondering who has access to which rooms and who is running the whole show."
7253645,Eric,5,"Great location, room is perfect for 1 person, no complaints at all.  The streetcar stops right in front of the building so it's easy to get around, also a great area for walking and close to lots of food and bars."
7253645,Kenesha,5,The place was quiet and clean. Perfect for a the weekend stay in Toronto! Close by so many restaurants and stores so it was very convenient for just about traveler needs. Definitely would return
7253645,Noah,5,Thomas and Madeline were great throughout the whole process. The space as a whole was great and would definitely stay again if I find my way back that way!
7253645,Tara,4,"The apartment itself is great. Nice touches on the food/snacks and fully loaded kitchen (with Keurig!). However, I feel I should also note that the building is next to a homeless shelter or sorts and there are often 5-10 people hanging around the front steps smoking etc. It didnâ€™t make me feel the best coming home alone after dark. Also the building smells like a frat party. I will emphasize that once in the apartment all is great, just the rest made me a bit uneasy."
7253645,Annapurna,2,The hosts were great and very responsive but the apartment was terrible. There was a crowd of homeless people on the front steps who shouted at me. The room was tiny and rundown. Everything smelled like cigarettes. About 30 minutes into my stay a man began running and screaming in the hallway. It sounded like he was having a psychotic break. He tried to open everyoneâ€™s door. He tried to open my door for quite a while. I was beyond terrified. After his voice got quieter I bolted out of the building. I live in a major US city with one of the highest violent crime rates in the country. I have a very high tolerance for this type of situation but even I was scared. I had to find a new Airbnb last minute since Iâ€™ll never ever go back there.
7324823,Ant,5,We had a great stay - Shannon made it all very smooth and easy!
7324823,Josiah,5,"Everything you need is in the area and Shannon is always a text away to help if needed. If you like a diverse selection of food and easy transportation, stay here"
7324823,Lauren,5,The space was roomy and nicely furnished. It has easy access to great restaurants as well as public transportation/a quick rideshare to the downtown area.
7324823,Katherine,5,"This cozy and stylish space was the perfect location to experience all that Toronto has to offer.  Shannon was incredibly welcoming and accommodating, and even allowed a slightly earlier check-in.  Plenty of little shops surround the immediate area and the location is right by the train for further exploring.  This is a wonderful and convenient place to stay and I hope to visit again soon!"
7324823,Sarah,4,"A nice place located in the Parkdale neighborhood in Toronto. Shannon's airbnb has easy access on Queen Street to the Tram and also various little shops along that street. Place is clean, and essentially good for what you're paying. 

Bed is comfy, towels and extra sheets/blankets provided, and other little amenities are also provided."
7341262,Chris,5,Its a great place for the price and location
7341262,Kim-Anh,5,great value and fast communication
7341262,Emma,5,Great value for the space and location! Nikâ€™s place was super clean as well
7341262,Bijoy,5,This place is perfect for a quick weekend excursion to Toronto! Would recommend!
7341262,Morgan,5,A wonderful place to stay. The location was very clean and anything needed for a quick trip was provided. Excellent value for the price.
7349220,Paul,5,"Great spot, very clean and comfortable."
7349220,Tom,5,Our second stay with Mark.  Great value in the heart of a great neighborhood.  Looking forward to returning there.
7349220,Serge,5,The great place and great location. Amazing host. Great value. Highly recommend it.
7349220,Elizabeth,5,Mark's studio was quaint and a great place for rest during our trip. He has great suggestions and is very helpful and knowledgeable on the area. His responses were always clear and quickly penned. The area surrounding his place is beautiful and very much worth exploring. All of the personal touches and suggestions ensured that we had an amazing stay in the Leslieville/Toronto area.
7349220,Jena,5,It was our second time staying at marks place and it was just as amazing as the first time we were there! We went to a concert at the opera house and it was literally a 5 minute walk to and from the venu which was super convenient!
7610557,Tara,5,"Wonderful stay in a well appointed downtown condo. 
Great view of CN Tower. Downtown Toronto is so walkable and Lyft easy to get. 
Loved the soaking bathtub."
7610557,Dave,5,"Great host and a fantastic stay.  Christopher was very quick to respond to questions and provided extremely detailed instructions for checking in.  The place was immaculate, well appointed, in a great location, and the skyline view is awesome.  I didn't want to leave and would definitely stay again!"
7610557,Sherry,5,Christopher place is wonderful! Comfy and stylish and centrally located with nice restaurants and places to hang out. Christopher is prompt responses and extremely hospitable! If we ever make it to Toronto Canada we are definitely staying again!!!!
7610557,Tyler,5,The host is very thorough with communication and check-in instructions. The condo is very clean and the location is unbeatable. Not to mention the morning view of the city you wake up to.
7610557,Melissa,5,The space and location was amazing! Getting around Toronto was easy. There were five of us and we were very comfortable. Christopher responded quickly to messages and check-in and out was simple.
8237869,David,4,This is a great place in a nice neighborhood!  It is very well kept and the houses around here are beautiful. Note that the entrance is downstairs from the front door and you need to buy a pass for on street overnight parking. The apartment is clean and we even got a bottle of wine and package of popcorn! Also Phil had literature available to help us decide what to do. We love Toronto and the shops and parks are great!
8237869,Elizabeth,4,The place was very cute and cozy! A cute little neighborhood that was very busy. Close parking was a little difficult to find on the street especially if you're not great at parking. We appreciated the nice surprise treat when we arrived. The bed was also very comfy and I liked the fact that there were extra blankets available. Short walk to public transit. A more clear explanation on where to enter exactly into the suite would have been helpful since it was very difficult to see at night. I would stay here again!
8237869,Shestin,4,"Super cute neighborhood, easy access to public transportation"
8237869,Nicole,4,"Philâ€™s place was clean and had so many thoughtful details! There were many considerate touches throughout the place. Both the bed and couch bed were very comfortable. Also Phil was really easy to communicate with!
The reasons I rated this place 4 stars were:
1) While the location is awesome, attaining the parking permit was difficult. The Toronto City website didnâ€™t work on my phone and constantly froze even on a computer. And after jumping through all the hoops to print, it ended up costing us $17 for a 48hr permit. 
2) You can easily hear anyone walking and talking upstairs. If you are a light sleeper maybe this isnâ€™t the place for you. 
Otherwise we had a very enjoyable stay!"
8237869,Maxime,3,"Phil was kind. The location was pretty good, close to lake Ontario.A little small for a family of 4. And the caught's mattress wasn't enough comfortable."
8355488,Braxton,5,Awesome place in awesome location!
8355488,Yosneida,5,"Ideal location to explore downtown Toronto, and host was kind."
8355488,Adam,5,"CJâ€™s apartment was the perfect place for me to stay on my weekend trip to Toronto.  It is located perfectly with a countless amount of bars, restaurants, and shopping within a 5 / 10 minute walk.  The apartment itself was great also.  It had  a very modern design and the bed was unbelievably comfortable.  The central air worked great and helped me stay cold and comfortable on a hot day.  The 70 inch tv was visible from both the couch and the bed.  The modern / clean bathroom also had a huge rain shower head which was great. Would recommend this apt to anyone !"
8355488,Gaurav,5,"I highly recommend CJ and his suite near the fashion district! It's right in the midst of the best nightlife in Toronto, and if you decide you want to stay in rather than hit the town CJ's suite is downright luxurious, with decor and furnishings that are both stylish and comfortable. Between the balcony, the giant TV, and the rainfall shower this was a great place to call home for my most recent stay in Toronto. CJ is super responsive and provided thorough instructions on how to check in and enjoy the suite. I would love to stay here again!"
8355488,William,5,"Very clean, and everything matched the description. Great location, close to main attractions in the Toronto area. Would highly recommend if looking for a classier place than typical hotel rooms."
8473716,Ian,5,Our experience was amazing and this place is in a great location!
8473716,Tonya,5,Had a great time! Amyâ€™s place was very clean. Her instructions for check in was very detailed. Hope to visit again! Highly recommend.
8473716,Ryan,5,Hardest part was the parking garage and that was as easy as it can get. Exceptional place and location.
8473716,Stevens,5,"Amyâ€™s place was very clean and cozy, the stay was perfect and sheâ€™s very quick with responses!"
8473716,Kendrell,4,Great location
9078948,Torsten,5,"Fantastic location, great view from the panoramic windows as well the balcony. Great places to eat nearby, e.g. Amsterdam Brewhouse and Trattoria Mercator."
9078948,Courtney,4,"Great location, great communication from host. Comfortable bed but could definitely use a new set of sheets"
9078948,Paul,4,Great location and good value for the money

9214758,Kyla,5,Perfect spot for my work trip! Close to many restaurants
9214758,Clare,5,Great location and quick replies. The apartment was a terrific value and I would definitely stay again.
9214758,Faye-Lyne,4,This place was good for a quick overnight in the city.
9214758,Alex,4,"Michelle was really accommodating and communicated well.   I thought the value of the Airbnb was just average.  I stayed in a much nicer Airbnb 2 nights before in Toronto for same price.    Not having AC is advertised but you really need to pay attention to the utilities section which is sometimes is disregarded by accident. 

If you looking for nice this doesnâ€™t really fit the bill.  But Michelle was great.  The shower was the best part in the accommodations with good shampoo and soap."
9325311,Alison,5,Great location and place!
9325311,Yolanda,5,Great location for the price.
9325311,Megan,5,Sam was very responsive and accommodating! The condo is so convenient and has a great view! Highly recommend!

9325311,Victoria,5,"The location is fantastic, youâ€™re right near all the big attractions and youâ€™re extremely close to Union Station which takes you to the airport and back"
9382997,Becca,5,A great spot! It felt extremely safe and well kept.
9382997,Gavin,5,"Excellent communication, cozy space, awesome neighborhood. Loved our stay!"
9382997,Andrew,5,Karen's place is great for couple. Paid parking and subway are practically next door. It's also right in the Greektown so plenty of restaurants around.
9382997,Thomas,5,"This place is spotless, with all the basic amenities and is literally steps (a two minute walk) to the subway. The neighborhood is quiet but not sleepy - there was a street festival going on a block away while we were there. I spent three nights and had a restful sleep every time. I would definitely stay here again."
9382997,John,5,"Karen was great, very sweet and understanding. The unit has a very good location, you can get easily to central Toronto by train, there are many good coffee shops and restaurants just around the corner! The ceiling of the unit is low since the studio is located in the basement but we got used to it and that wasn't a problem. The water pressure in the shower wasn't strong enough for our liking. Besides that, the space was very cozy and has as many heaters as you could ask for, Karen left extra towels and cosmetics to make sure we had everything what's needed and what you might forget to take with you, especially travelling light! Thank you Karen for being so welcoming and understanding!  Highly recommended!"
9509339,Jack,5,Highly recommend!! Great stay with a better view
9509339,Mikey,5,You can expect 5 star views with an easy check in and out. MJ was more than helpful with answering all of my questions. Great spot.
9509339,Sandra,5,"It was lovely. Everything was clean and as described. Mj's flat is everything you need for a few days in Toronto. Quiet, cozy and really high in the building overlooking part of Toronto including the CM Tower. Check-in was very easy too! Would book it again."
9509339,Mario,5,"Amazing view, clean and stylish. Quick and effective communication."
9509339,Thejodhar,5,Just as described with a view of CN tower just like in the picture. Clean unit.

9651151,Hazel,5,Harryâ€™s communication was great throughout. His place is situated in a great location. It was walkable to great restaurants and bars. We really enjoyed our stay!
9651151,Colleen,5,"Harry's place is in one of the few quiet, quaint neighborhoods in the city. It is just a couple of blocks away from the Distillery District. The space itself is recently updated. It is all very clean and comfortable. Harry was there to greet us when we arrived. He was so welcoming and friendly. We really enjoyed our stay."
9651151,John,4,"Close to Distillery District and St. Lawrence Market. Nightlife is rather limited in the area, but rally nice part of town."

9969830,Caroline,5,"Vasilyâ€™s place was exactly as described! It was a great location, clean apartment and overall a lovely place to stay in Toronto. I will definitely stay again if Iâ€™m back in in the city. Check in was a very simple process and Vasily gives great instructions for everything you may need and is very responsive. Overall a 10/10 stay!"
9969830,Jake,5,"Excellent location, super clean and modern condo unit with parking included!  It's an equivalent of a 4 or 4.5 star hotel room. I would definitely come back again!"
9969830,Mburu,5,"Great view , nice space , great location near the highway and the host was super fast to respond to my messages no matter the time of day or night"
9969830,Ã–mer,5,"A very weil-thought Check-in instruction was Provided Boy vasily. In Addition, the Appartement Location and view on the CN tower were really good. The emnities within the apartment were really helpful. I can only recommend this apartment. We had a really good time there. Thank you very much vasily!"

10773960,Nicole,5,"Our family loved staying at this beautiful, stylish and spacious home! In the morning we walked to nearby Kensington Market for an incredible breakfast. The rest of the time we were conveniently located, often within walking distance, to all the other activities we had planned or just happened into. Shopping in Yorkville, The Royal Ontario Museum, Gardner Ceramic Museum, Bata Shoe Museum, with the CN Tower, a show at the Royal Alexander Theater, and a ferry to Center Island just a bit further. Being able to come back to a proper home with a kitchen at the end of the day is priceless. There were tons of fantastic delivery food options when we didnâ€™t feel like cooking or going out. I donâ€™t know why anyone would ever stay in a hotel, and pay more for a family to do it! We canâ€™t wait to come back."
10773960,Judy,4,A beautiful home on a quiet street near the University.    Plenty of space.  The house is clean and the architectural  details are beautiful.   Beds are very comfortable and when the weather is mild the patio is good place to hang out. Cooking for 4 with the accessories in the kitchen was tricky.  We had lovely meals in the beautiful kitchen just needed to improvise  cooking methods.  The location is just a few steps from the streetcar.

11068703,Theodore,2,Make sure you have clear instructions about checking in
11068703,Monika,3,"This place was great in terms of location, price, and cleanliness. It takes awhile to go up and down on the elevator (especially when there are a lot of people) so budget extra time if you are in a hurry. Having access to the gym/pool downstairs, and Netflix in the condo was also nice. The towels could use an upgrade (smelled like mildew), but everything else was fine."
11221319,Jeffrey,5,"Condo was lovely and in a great location. View from rooftop patio was amazing. We had a great time in the city and felt comfortable, relaxed, and at home. Would definitely try and stay again."

11324662,Sherri,5,"Jonathanâ€™s place is in a great location central to the train station, the CN Tower and the aquarium.  The underground PATH walkway is close by.  The views on the CN Tower are mesmerizing at night.  The bedrooms are separated by the living space which provides privacy for two people.   Highly recommended."

11324662,Camille,5,"Clean, comfortable, stylish, and terrific views!!  Jonathan provided detailed check-in instructions, and was quick to respond to any question. An underground parking spot was a great perk."

11324869,Megan,5,Check in was easy and the place had plenty of space and a huge bed and nice backyard. The coffee machine was great and there were nice shampoos and conditioners provided. Great place would definitely stay again!
11324869,Kayley,5,Great place to stay! It was super clean and it was exactly what I expected.
11324869,Estevan,5,"Victorias spots may have been the most comfortable place I stayed on my whole trip on the East, and provided just the right touches to make me feel like this was a home for the few days I was there. If given the chance I would stay there again in a heart beat. Couldn't ask for anything more."
11431453,Vinny,5,This place is fantastic if you're visiting Toronto!
11431453,Jonathan,5,Great spot and great location. Would highly recommend for anyone on a quick trip to Toronto
11431453,Katelyn,5,"This place was great! The location was awesome as there were tons of restaurants near by and also the Allen Gardens, which me and my sister absolutely loved!

11533218,Hannah,5,"Walkable to most everything we did, lovely view, and great communication from host. Thanks, Alper!"
11533218,Pamela,5,"5 star it tis! I now see why the reviews were exceptional.  Everything was wonderful!  My hubby and I celebrated our 10th wedding Anniversary in Toronto, and this space was amazing!  This was the first Airbnb that we'd rented for pleasure and this experiences gives us an incentive to do so again in the future.

The location was perfect and in walking distance  of restaurants and attractions. We arrived early, and Alper hired an additional cleaner to allow us in earlier (at no cost to us). During our stay, he was super responsive on the rare occasions that I needed to ask a question, and he took the initiative to check in several times to ensure that we were okay. Awesome host!"
11533218,Kelsey,5,The place was perfect! Incredible view of the city and the location was central to the entire city. I would absolutely stay here again.
11533218,Jannina,5,"Prime spot for food and shopping. Walking distance from the CN Tower and shops. I loved the stay. Super nice, cozy, and clean."
11648181,Brooke,5,"Absolutely loved staying at Olyaâ€™s apartment! If you are looking for an apartment in Toronto, do not hesitate booking this one! It is in a great location and well maintained. No need to provide toiletries as Olya provides everything you might need! The welcome champagne in the fridge was a kind touch!"
11648181,Rich,5,"By far the BEST experience I have ever had with Airbnb. Highly, highly, highly recommend staying here!"
11648181,Michael,5,Olyaâ€™s place was perfect!  Will definitely look it up next time Iâ€™m in Toronto

11675421,Johnathan,5,David was great and extremely responsive. His place is very close to a variety of attractions and we didnâ€™t have to take the train even once during our 5-day stay. I would highly recommend this space for anyone looking to explore Toronto and everything it has to offer.
11675421,Prateek,5,The best part of Daveâ€™s airbnb is the location. Itâ€™s right in front of Dufferin mall & walkable to transit station. The place was super clean with all necessary items in there.
11675421,Claire,4,"Great location as far as transport, stores and cafes and park.located on a busy street and apartment was not so bright or light( not as depicted  in photos)paid Parking offered is outside and in a back lane not right by unit.A little noisy and not well ventilated."

11941691,Rebecca,5,High recommendation! Nice place and Simin is very nice person! It was pretty good experience!
11941691,Adam,5,"LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION! Siminâ€™s place was absolutely amazing, smack in the middle of downtown Toronto. Simin was accommodating with both a late check-in, and allowed us to keep our bags there after checkout until our flight. Anytime something was needed, Simin would reply within minutes. The place is beautiful as well! When visiting Toronto again, I can only hope her place is available!"

11960053,Amir,5,its for one person really short stay

11960053,Aaron,5,Comfortable stay and great location. Would come back.
11960053,Amir,4,The place location is right for almost every one but the mattress really need to change tgere is no way two person can fit there

12007026,Lorena,5,Very clean home and very friendly! Location is very ideal!
12007026,Francisco,5,"The location was close to transportation, shops and restaurants. Room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was shared with other guests in the house. You can you use the kitchen to prepare your own meal.  Overall a great stay for my vacation.
Thank you."
12007026,Sunny,4,Located at a convenient place so it was easy to travel.
12007026,Isabela,2,Expect fucking frying smell at 10 in the evening!!!!~ FUCK YOU!
12064625,Mattias,5,The apartment and location were great!  The views from the top floor balcony were stunning.  Check in was smooth and having free parking available was a great benefit.  Host was quick to respond to any questions we had and was very pleasant throughout.  Would come back again!

12064625,Rashaun,5,"Our stay was amazing! The 67th floor view is beautiful, as we spent our mornings watching planes take off from the small airstrip far below. The condo was very clean and stylish. Check in and check out was a very easy process. The location was in the middle of the Entertainment District and did not disappoint. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone coming to the Toronto area!"
12064625,Magdalena,5,"The place was very clean and well stocked with items. We loved the view it was beautiful at night time and in the morning. The location was the best we have had. We walked everywhere and everything was so close by, grocery store was across the street basically, and the CN tower was down the street. Everything was amazing, will definitely stay here again."
12290314,Andrew,5,"Are usually donâ€™t write reviews, but this place is perfect in every way. This was my wife and Iâ€™s first Airbnb experience and it was executed flawlessly!"
12290314,Yuchi,5,"Amazing location and great communication. Could not have asked for a better experience in Toronto! The apartment was spotless, the view was breathtaking, and the bed was comfortable. Will definitely reach out again when I return to Toronto."

12290314,Penny,5,"Beautiful, clean, and comfortable in a central location. The parking garage below the building was also convenient."
12290314,Jeffrey,5,"What can I say?  This was my fifth visit to this listing.  Preparing to book a sixth. 

Jeffery is on time and friendly with each communication. Accomadating in any extra need. 

The location, view and on site parking are unparalleled. 

Canâ€™t wait to return."
12301555,Becky,5,Wonderful host and amazing condo
12301555,Sean,5,"Great location, nice space"
12301555,Zachery,5,"Oscars place was clean and bright, it has a nice balcony with two chairs that is great in the summer time. The CN tower is viewable from the balcony as well!"
12301555,Daniel,5,Great location for anyone looking to stay downtown near the attractions.
12301555,Rachel,3,"Oscars place was definitely clean & nice, but unless you choose correctly on where to park youâ€™re going to spend a fortune on parking and itâ€™s not going to be that great a value of a place to stay! Also that sliding door does not close!!!"
12447108,Connie,5,Excellent 1 bedroom studio apartment - great bed!  Perfect for me as a solo working person attending TIFF. Could walk everywhere. Thanks Stella!
12447108,Paul,5,Stellaâ€™s airbnb is very clean and very well situated in a prime location. Only a 10 minute walk from union station.  I would definitely stay at stellaâ€™s again the next time Iâ€™m back in Toronto.
12447108,Lotta,5,"We stayed at Stellaâ€™s for TIFF and her place was just great - clean, functional and smack in the middle of it all! Stella communicated with us very well and everything in the apartment was as expected !
I can wholeheartedly recommend Stellaâ€™s place if you are visiting Toronto and especially for any of the Enterainment district attractions !"
12447108,Paul,5,"A wise choice for anyone looking to be at the heart of the Entertainment district!  Stylish, very comfortable, and a crazy good deal for the price."
12447108,Marlo,4,Stella's place is in a great location and she is a very responsive host. Check in and out was super easy. The apartment is quiet and the bed is cozy making for a good night's sleep.

12605193,Johan,5,Perfect location. Is to reach anything. Parking if needed. Nice and clean. Couldnâ€™t ask for more
12605193,Amanda,5,Great place in an excellent location. Jay is a very friendly and helpful host. We would definitely stay in his place again!
12605193,Torsten,5,Nice and clean apartment and easy to access. Jay was very responsive and accommodating. Extra credit: itâ€™s 11 min walking distance from Porter airport!
12605193,Silvi,4,"Great location, 20-30 mins from everything, good price, perfect for the independent explorer or couples."
12836500,Anni,5,"I had a pleasant stay at Azin's apartment. The location is great, steps away from the street car. The studio is amazing with its stylish decor and amenities, which has a gym, an indoor pool and sauna."
12836500,Erica,5,Had a fantastic stay. Azin was super helpful
12836500,Tom,4,"Great location, and a very responsive host!"
12836500,Bryan,4,Great location! We enjoyed our stay.
12836500,Jean,3,"This condo may be modern but it is not cute, in fact rather esthetically unpleasing except for the bathroom. it needs a thorough cleaning as well. The picture, as noted by another guest, is deceiving. It doesn't show the bed in the middle of the room just one foot away from the couch. The rest of the condo is the foyer and bathroom, so it's really in the nature of a bachelor studio. Windows and door to small balcony look out on a freeway and many high-rise condo buildings. Kitchen utensils for cooking were nearly nonexistent. No breakfast is provided. Host was hostile and misleading in dealing with problem that arose although the problem was eventually solved. This listing does have the advantage of an excellent location."
12932745,Tamia,5,Very nice and comfortable. Everything was neat and well put together. And affordable prices.
12932745,Scott,5,Great location and very clean.
12932745,CraftyFarmGirl (Aimee),5,"Lina's apartment was in a great downtown location with pretty views and a balcony! Watch her very informative video prior to arriving and you'll understand how to find the building and the check-in process. It was spotless upon our arrival and had everything that we needed. The building was very nice and had a gym that my daughter said was really nice; well equipped and had great views of the city out the windows. The parking was a great bonus in an area where parking can be difficult. I think for all that it offered it was a great value, and would definitely stay there again. Lina's response to communication was very quick, and she was very patient with me through a bit of a key debacle that was completely my fault."
12932745,Olivia,5,"The space is beautiful and in a great neighborhood! Awesome apartment.  The check in was annoying- and made extremely overcomplicated by the video provided to detail how to enter the apartment.  It was misleading and confusing.  Also- it was not supplemented by written directions- so you had to rely on that. My service wasnâ€™t great so it was hard to watch the video, and upon arrival I couldnâ€™t go back and watch it due to lack of service.  If there were written instructions in addition to the video I would have had no complaints."
12932745,Jennifer,4,"This was my first time to Toronto, ON and this place is such a great location ... close to quite a lot of downtown and included a parking space."
13001726,Kevin,5,Great place to stay.
13001726,Madelyn,5,"Absolutely wonderful place to stay! The room is shiny clean, cozy and has everything youâ€™ll need. Itâ€™s nice and private and feels very safe. The neighborhood is safe, clean, fun and great to walk around. The hosts are kind, quick to respond and accommodating. I would love to stay here again!"
13001726,Taylor,5,"Majaâ€™s place is truly the loveliest Airbnb Iâ€™ve ever stayed at. This is my third stay here, and is certainly not my last!"
13001726,Claudia,5,"Will definitely return to this room, loved the style and loved the location.. Maja was very helpful and quick to respond if we had any questions"
13001726,Taylor,5,This is my second (and certainly not my last) stay at Maja's. I can't say enough about the space or the location!
13174614,Sarah,5,Great stay!
13174614,Marissa,5,Great location with restaurant and bars in walking distance! Location and building felt safe. Perfect for 1-2 people.
13174614,Hailee,5,Gorgeous place! Perfect little touch of cute and modern! It's in a great area of Toronto and was close to everything that I had planned on doing! Definitely worth booking!
13174614,Taylor,5,Weiru's apartment is in a great location by the lake and an easy walk to most spots in Toronto.  Having a parking spot is clutch!
13174614,Sydney,5,Nice cute place!! Great central location and pretty view!
13475435,Kerry,5,"I stay in a lot of Airbnbâ€™s, and Iâ€™m lucky to often have good hosts, but Aaron goes above and beyond to make your stay great. Cannot say enough about his helpfulness and attentiveness while I was in Toronto."
13475435,Filipe,5,"The place is super cozy and has everything you need. Clean, comfy bed, coffee etc and the location is the best with many options all around as far as food, bars, transportation and Aaron is super responsive and attentive. 5 stars!"
13475435,Douglas,5,Exceptional host. Great communication and easy to work with. Fast easy check-in. Cozy and quiet. Highly recommend. Wonderful neighborhood with great food around ever corner.
13475435,Kristen,5,"Aaron's apartment is in a great location. Off the beaten path in a slightly quieter neighborhood, but close to many of the main streets for bars/restaurants. Definitely in the ""hip"" part of town. Grocery store very close buy, and all coffee/restaurant/bar needs you could ever as for. The apartment is cozy and small, definitely great for one person, tight for two, but doable as long as you are used to living in close quarters together. The unit had great AC, a TV with Roku, and a VERY comfy bed. Check in was easy and efficient and above all Aaron was extremely communicative and quick to respond to any questions I had. A great spot!"
13475435,Ale,5,"Aarons place is perfect if you are visiting Toronto,  it is super cute and cozy! Look no more and stay here!!! (Best thai food ever is just a few minutes away... Sukhothai!!!!)"
13476773,Matthew,5,"Modern, clean, and exceptionally located studio!  Great stay!"
13476773,Anna,5,"Perfect place for a business trip! Great location, very clean and cozy, loved it! Would be happy to stay again!"
13476773,Erin,5,The space is small but comfortable. The location is great. If you are not familiar with Toronto know that there is the convenience of the Queen streetcar steps from the front door but that also comes with the noise of the streetcar so if you are a light sleeper it may not work for you. Great hosts who were friendly and were quick to respond.
13476773,Abby,5,Lovely host and a cute little place if youâ€™re looking for somewhere within a ten minute drive to downtown Toronto! The host assists you with figuring out parking details as well which I thought was very thoughtful!
13476773,Jade,5,"Krumeâ€™s place is exceptional! It is conveniently located on Queen Street and about a one-minute walk to the bus stop on the 501 line. The apartment itself is sparkling clean and modern, and whatâ€™s most amazing is our communication with the host. Krume is extremely responsive and cares for our stay, and had given us many helpful tips for traveling in Toronto. My friend and I really enjoyed our stay at Krumeâ€™s charming apartment and would highly recommend it to anyone else!"
13532029,Natalie,5,We LOVED this place! It had everything we needed! We had an amazing time and couldnâ€™t get over the view. Woke up to a beautiful sunrise! We only stayed one night but we WISH we couldâ€™ve stayed longer! Thanks so much!!
13532029,Rebecca,5,"Excellent communication with the hosts, who were also  very accomodating. Location is perfect. A quiet retreat which allows one to thoroughly enjoy all the city has to offer."
13532029,Kristen,5,"The view. It was unbelievable. What a cool, unique place to stay in such a great city. We walked everywhere!!"
13532029,Stephen,3,"Excellent location and good value for money. We had a wonderful time, but with a few exceptions that would keep us from coming back. The fire alarm was being tested for hours during the day, and multiple false alarms occurred in the middle of the night (and signage in the apartment indicated this might be a frequent occurrence). The place was a good enough size for two people for a few days, and the view was exactly as incredible as we expected, but the rest of the experience and the lack of small touches didnâ€™t measure up to the AirBnb Plus moniker."
13532029,Vanessa,3,"The host were lovely and easy to reach at all times. The air b&b was in a nice location with a lovely view but IT WAS SMALL very small. I wouldnâ€™t recommend this place for more than one person, YES one even if itâ€™s your significant other the place is too small. Itâ€™s honestly smaller than a standard hotel room"
13605471,Patrick,5,"This coach house was everything we could have asked for! It was super cozy and hard to leave after the week was over! Brett is also super communicative and friendly, I would recommend this place a thousand times over! Loved staying here!"
13605471,Sarah,5,"It was the perfect space for reconnecting with an old friend while having easy access to great food (highly recommend Goods and Provisions for dinner) and little shops in Leslieville, plus quick access to Toronto. We actually returned relatively early in the evenings to enjoy the space and play backgammon. We did not use the woodstove after seeing the notes about how it can cause the sleeping area to become too hot. This meant the main area of the little cottage was a bit chilly (maybe 65F) but there were lots of blankets available, so we wrapped up and were fine, and then slept great in the loft. Highly recommend."
13605471,Lisa,5,"Brett's cabin in the city is truly a hidden gem. 

Everything from his impeccable communication, easy check in and convenient location, to the fabulous design of the space, made our stay very memorable. I can't recommend this place highly enough. We loved the coziness of the cabin and the loft sleeping area left us feeling very restful. The space was so comfortable that we opted for a night in to drink delicious beer and enjoy the house rather than going out! 

Thanks again, Brett!"
13605471,Mike,5,This place is even better than the pics show. Itâ€™s super clean and comfortable and give your own quite place in a great town. The town around the place is great to walk around in and is fun for all times of day. Itâ€™s also close enough to the city that you can Uber to anywhere no problem.
13605471,Eva,5,"Brettâ€™s cottage in Toronto was absolutely beautiful. Itâ€™s location is very convenient for anyone visiting the city. The decor of the place is exactly how it looks in the pictures: artful, clean, and cozy. If I am ever in the area again I will definitely look out for this adorable home!"
13700719,Tiffany,5,We had a great time!
13700719,Abhishek,5,"This place is really nice. Small studio. Good for two people. Perfectly located in the downtown area and easy walk to many tourist attraction. The apartment is on the 66th floor with great views. Union station is 4 mins walk. I took the train in and out to the airport (Pearson) and my wife flew into billy bishop which was 7-8 mins drive. 
Getting Uber was really easy and the host was very quick on responding to a couple of questions we asked. 
overall if you are in Toronto for visit this place is perfect to stay! 
Thank you Lan for having us!!"
13700719,April,5,"We absolutely loved our stay in Toronto. The location was PERFECT for all the adventures we wanted to take and places to go while in the city. It was in walking distance from pretty much everything including Scotiabank, Rogers Center, the aquarium and Union Station. We couldnâ€™t have asked for better accommodations. The view was also breathtaking. We would go back or recommend this to any of our friends!"
13700719,Karissa,5,"Land's place we absolutely amazing! I happened to be in town during the NBA playoffs and was able to walk out to Jarrasic Park and experience watching the game with the locals. I loved being on the 66th floor, the view was amazing! I plan to visit Toronto again and I will definitely stay at Lan's place"
13700719,Sara,4,Amazing view and perfect for a couple.
13714921,Jorge,5,"Great value, great location, easy check-in and very clean. Apartment was just as described."
13714921,Robert /Lucille,5,This is comfortable and very ckean space close to Toronto's center. I recommend it to everybody.
13714921,Jennifer,5,"The apartment was clean, and relatively close to everything that we wanted to see and do while we were in Toronto"
13714921,Jonathan,4,r
13714921,Lawrence,4,I loved the space
13715751,Nathan,5,"Centrally located to downtown and very close to CN Tower, Rogers Center, and Scotiabank Arena."
13715751,Hanna,5,"Martha's place was amazing! The view was so stunning that my friend and I had breakfast at the place (we usually don't). You get a bang for your buck with how clean and stylish it is too. Literally the place was a hop, skip, and a jump to places such as  Union Station, CN Tower, and Ripleys Aquarium. Would recommend Martha's place to anyone!"
13715751,Ashley,5,Great location able to walk to a lot. The apartment was tinier than expected but we didnâ€™t stay in the room much so it did not make a huge difference to us.
13715751,Kevin,5,Nice place for our first visit to Toronto! Room was clean and comfortable. Location is awesome right in the middle of everything!
13715751,Tejaswini,5,Great location! At a walking distance from CN Tower and lake-front attractions. Sparkling clean unit. Easy checking and checkout. Host was easy to reach and was very helpful.
13716594,Caiden,5,Really great location and easy check in with a convenient city parking lot across the street. The room was perfect for two people.
13716594,Shannon,5,Amazing location ! Super clean ! The only thing that was an issue was no tv and a lock on the thermostat so it was a little warm
13716594,Jyotika,4,"Clean, convenient, affordable. I was traveling alone and needed a safe, economical, non-fancy and clean place for myself. I stayed at their loft apartment the earlier night and that wasnâ€™t available again, so I got this place. Both apartments are good."
13716594,Dylan,4,Nice place to stay with easy access to downtown
13716594,Teena,1,"This place was built to make money, not provide hospitality or make a cozy atmosphere. It was more sterile than clean. It was freezing in there and I do not recommend staying there in cold months. Although they turned up the heat (remotely) I think, it was still cold. We turned down our blanket and realized there was no top sheet only a fitted sheet, which is gross! How many people have slept with that comforter on them! Disgusting! There were no extra sheets or blankets. Our romantic night turned into sleeping fully clothed with hats on to stay warm! To top it off I complained that there were no washcloths and was told by them that each guest gets 1 towel! I just wanted to wash my makeup off! In the morning we were woken by housekeeping knocking on the door even though we were granted a late checkout. We tried to savor the night and take a hot shower before we left and SURPRISE no hot water!! Are you kidding me!!!! It was an absolute disaster and we will never stay there again! Plus they were not helpful at all with giving me close parking lots near them, I was told they couldnâ€™t help me but when we got there, there was a parking lot right across the street! After paying $58 dollars to park for the night we would of been better getting a hotel!"
13765249,Patrick,5,"The definition of getting more than you paid for... this condo is incredible! Beautiful views, excellent amenities, and even better communication and service!"
13765249,Mohammad,5,"Great place, beautiful view.  Close to most attractions."
13765249,Cynthia,5,Martha's place is perfectly situated near the center of downtown and Union Station.  Incredible views and everything you need at your finger tips.
13765249,Kathy,5,Cool flat in a location thatâ€™s convenient to Union Stationâ€” and basically everything in Toronto. The view was flabbergasting! We would return again.
13765249,Jay,4,Apartment was exactly as described. Nice view. Very clean
13769161,Janie,5,Maureen is a wonderful host! Check out High Park when you stay here
13769161,Erica,5,Maureen is very communicative and helpful. I definitely would stay with her again.
13769161,Baba,5,Maureen and Harvey were very hospitable. Getting to the old Toronto downtown area and to the airport from their place was as convenient as can be. Highly recommend.
13769161,Melissa,5,"We enjoyed our stay at Maureenâ€™s place. It was very clean, easy to check-in, easy to find parking, etc. We chose to walk everywhere and it was a little far for that, but we easily couldâ€™ve taken public transportation. Overall, I would recommend staying when in Toronto!"
13769161,Andi,5,Maureen was great! She was very quick to respond to our messages. And very flexible with check-in. We wanted to park our car on the street and take public transit downtown and didn't know how late we would be back. Maureen let us drop our stuff off early before check-in and grab keys so we could stay out as late as we wanted without worrying about having to get back and check in.
13879930,Randall,5,Great location and host!
13879930,Kristyn,5,1 night stay was great for a quick trip.
13879930,Stephen,5,This is a great condo in a very convenient location. Everything was spotlessly clean and Matt was super friendly and accessible. Iâ€™d stay here again.
13879930,Jennifer,4,"The condo is really cute, and perfect for 2 people. The location is great and within walking distance of a all sorts of great attractions. A couple of drawbacks are no on-site parking and the need to download an app in order to initially get into the unit. While there is a great binder with places of interest, restaurants, etc., also Included were quite a few notes of things that couldn't be used. While I understand the need to set certain boundaries, it started to seem like we were an imposition, not paying customers."
13879930,Ben,4,"Matt was accommodating with the check-in process, great location, and very well kept. 

However, there was way too many instructions and rules which made me feel not at home at all. The apartment felt warm even with the AC on (I couldn't bring it lower past a temperature according to the rules.) I have encountered a couple of annoying fruit flies too."
14122952,Leo,5,"Max was a very warm and welcoming host. His place was clean, organized and served the needs of a 1 person stay for 3 days. Check-in/Check-out was extremely simple and would definitely stay with him again."
14122952,Simon,5,"I had a very comfortable and relaxing five-night stay at Maxâ€™s apartment while in town for a conference. Located right by the charming Cabbagetown neighborhood, with inexpensive shops, bars, cafes, and restaurants, Maxâ€™s place was very nice to retreat to after long days of conferencing. The room was very clean, quiet, and comfortable, and though the bathroom and kitchen are shared with other guests, I never had any problems with noise or conflicting schedules. It felt as if I had the apartment to myself! Max is a very gracious and available host, always to be reached for questions or concerns. I highly recommend!"
14122952,Eleanor,5,"Lots of convenient stuff near by and a really clean space. Max is very nice and quick to respond, ready with answers about how to get around the city and many other things.  Check in was smooth and comprehensive."
14122952,Ruichuan,5,"Clean, private room. And nice host."
14122952,Stephanie,5,I would recommend taking the buses & trains in the area to become familiar with Maxâ€™s place. The room was neat and clean. I would be out all day exploring the city and calmly unwind at the end of the day.
14202809,Martin,5,Great communication.
14202809,Tyler,5,Great space in an awesome location close to downtown!
14202809,Michelle,5,"Awesome location with a great view of the CN tower. Very safe neighborhood and an easy walk down Fort York to convenience stores, trendy bars and restaurants, the CN tower, and Blue Jays stadium to catch a game. Everything was very clean and comfortable for us. Made our home for the weekend in Toronto a great experience!"
14202809,Jimmy,5,Would definitely come back here
14202809,Lisa,3,"The apartement has great things and not so great details to it... it definitely wasnâ€™t as clean as described. Livingroom and kitchen where okay but the carpet In the bedroom was pretty dirty and so where to corners in the shower. There where also weird dots on the toilet seats and the AC didnâ€™t really work that well either, which shouldnâ€™t be a problem durin winter. The apartement has a weird smell to it which is why we kept the balcony door open most of the time which could get difficult during colder seasons. Besides that the location was great and the host was replying really fast which was great!"
14222776,Andres & Janet,5,"Loved everything about it. Amazing location and views from the balcony. We walked everywhere from there.. great nice, cozy and clean place!"
14222776,Megan,5,Jordanâ€™s apartment was in a good location. The apartment was comfortable for 4 of us and the extra room was a perfect size for 2 people in addition to the main room.
14222776,Nicole Sheet May,5,Jordan's place was great! Sparkling clean and well furnished in a fantastic location.  All our questions were answered very promptly and check in was super easy. Will stay again!
14222776,Molly,5,"The place was amazing! Location was awesome and the view was amazing. The only issue was that the WiFi listed didnâ€™t pop up so we didnâ€™t have access while we were there. Other than that it was perfect, would definitely stay again!"
14222776,Helen,5,"Amazing well appointed apartment in the heart of everything. Spacious, clean and functional space across the street from the CN Tower. Park your car in the secure provided space and walk around the city. Make sure you go down to the pool and gym. Will definitely book with Jordan again next time we are in the city. Thanks."
14266137,Jessi,5,"I had the best night's sleep here. Also I love being able to utilize a code to enter an airbnb and also having a lock on a bedroom door, makes me feel really safe. The value was great for this space."
14266137,Michael,5,"Staying here was a great choice! It's fairly close to many local restaurants, the subway, and the light rail; no more than a 10-15 minute walk away. 
The house itself is clean and cozy, especially with GnÃ¼dles around!"
14266137,Michael,5,"Easy check in, Rodney is a friendly and knowledgeable host. Nice breakfast in the morning. Great bright room and a large house and big kitchen. Really good location in the Bloordale village right on the busline ,which runs late and a few blocks from the Landsdowne subway station. Overall a great stay, and I'd be happy to book Rodney's place again."
14266137,Elisey,5,Convenient location near Lansdowne metro station. Everything was as expected/pictured. Floor is a bit squeeky. Rodney was very hospitable! Three nights went by quick.
14266137,Mary,5,We stayed for 2 nights and we felt really comfortable with his house. The Location is walking distance from Subway Station. The host was really friendly and understanding as well as fast responds. We enjoyed the days in this house and in Toronto. We will definetely come back to this house once we have chance to visit Toronto again. Thank you.
14303663,Hana,5,Good location and the host is so nice.
14303663,Erika,5,"Max is super nice.  The place is exactly as described.  Funny thing is even tho two others were staying when I was, I never saw them.  The room is nice and dark - just the way I like for sleeping - and if I wanted it colder or warmer, Max had that set up in case I needed it.  For the price it can't be beat!"
14303663,Ibrahim,5,Max's place is quite affordable given its location & I would gladly book it again for future visits.
14303663,Christina,4,Good place for the value.
14303663,Umar,4,Good place
14340935,Adriana,5,"Steve provided a wonderful guest environment! His apartment was in a great location and had a beautiful view, and all of his plants gave his place lots of personality. He gave us many good recommendations for food and activities around and had a good balance of giving us our privacy while also being accessible if needed. Our interactions were minimal but intimate as we were able to get to know each other a bit. Overall, his apartment was very quiet, comfortable, and convenient. I would definitely recommend a stay with Steve!"
14340935,Robby,5,"Steveâ€™s place is in a great location, it was clean, great value, and helpful local sightseeing tips given. It felt easy to stay there and his communication and the check in and out process was very fast and easy. 

He was very understanding when extenuating circumstances came up and I had to cancel my stay a bit early."
14340935,Brenda,5,Steve's place is beautiful.  The view is picturesque.  He is very accommodating and helpful.  The location is near to the TTC - Toronto transportation (bus and train).  The room is clean.
14340935,Christine,5,"Had a great time staying with Steve and Ayala. Their place was in the perfect spot for exploring downtown Toronto - very close to several transportation options (subway, bus, streetcar), and if you're up for a long walk, you can even get to downtown on foot. There are also a lot of restaurants, grocery stores, etc. in the area that were easy to walk to. The apartment itself is very clean, quiet, and private. Steve and Ayala are both super nice and welcoming, and were available to help when I needed it, but were also very unobtrusive and gave me a lot of space and privacy otherwise. They were also very good about communicating, especially around check in, which went very smoothly. I was traveling by myself and overall felt very safe and comfortable staying with them."
14340935,Courtney,5,Super great location that has access to bus and street car stops. It is a super cozy apartment with an amazing view.
14612719,Sharad,5,This place is at a very good location and has great value for money.
14612719,Shubkarman,5,Had a fantastic stay...really convenient location and a clean place...highly recommended
14612719,Florin,4,"Good host, good value and good location."
14612719,Annie,4,"Michalâ€™s place is a great value for a stay in Toronto! 
The location is a bit further out from the city center, but thatâ€™s made explicit in the space description. Public transit was easy enough as there are two Line 1 stops nearby plus the Yonge street bus. I got downtown for my conference both days I stayed easily. Plus, the area itself is nice with plenty of restaurants, grocery stores, and coffee shops. Thereâ€™s also a park and high walking track nearby for those interested.
The check in process was seamless, which I appreciated. The room was nice and I had no issues with the communal bathroom and kitchen. Luckily, all the other guests in the house adhered to the â€œquiet after 10â€ rule, so I was able to get a good nightâ€™s rest.
Overall, this place is functional and right for the price. You have to travel a bit to get downtown; itâ€™s an old house so this isnâ€™t a glimmering chic spotless experience; and youâ€™re sharing a kitchen and bathroom space with others. Iâ€™d say, keep the inexpensive price in mind when evaluating this space for your travel needs."
14612719,Emma,4,Good!
14669960,Andrea,5,Nice family and really quick to respond. Would stay with them again.
14669960,Yoni,5,"Very comfortable beds, and very dark sleeping conditions!"
14669960,Kristy,5,"My first airbnb experience couldnâ€™t have went any better! The suite is spacious, clean and has some nice touches to make you feel right at home, down to the artwork on the walls. I felt at home here and was able to sleep safely and comfortably, loved being able to meet the pup too! Will definitely stay again for the next trip."
14669960,Jesse,5,Expect a clean comfy home feel spot. Expect a gracious host who will help you out anyway possible. Very relaxing atmosphere. Almost didn't want to leave. Great location. Very accessible to downtown area by public transportation or driving.
14669960,Chris,5,We felt very welcomed.  Great location and the place was very clean.
14685177,Derek,5,Bradâ€™s place was exactly what I was looking for for my short stay in Toronto. Great location! Would stay again.
14685177,Alterra,5,Very nice and affordable place to stay in downtown Toronto. Literally next to everything - it's all <20 min walk.
14685177,Bryant,5,"Bradâ€™s place is Beautiful. Itâ€™s very convenient and near everything, if you canâ€™t walk to where you have to go Lyft or Uber can definitely get you there under $10. He is very responsive and I would definitely stay at his place again."
14685177,Allison,5,"Great location, central to all the tourist hotspots like the St Lawrence market, the ferry to Toronto island, Union Station and the CN tower. Super easy check in process and cheap parking within the building. Two bedrooms plus sleeper sofa was accommodated our group of 4. Would definitely stay here again!"
14685177,Mary,4,"We loved the location of this Airbnb. It was so easy to get around especially having two toddlers with us. There is a grocery store nearby, and a ton of restaurants. Brad a wonderful host who responds very quickly. I would recommend staying here!"

14800586,Taka,5,Abul is a kind person. He always helped me if I had problems.
14800586,Swapnik,5,It is very nice place to stay near downtown
14800586,Oludele,5,Totally worth it!
14800586,Cheryl,5,Convenient to the subway
14800586,Lisa,4,Great deal! Hard to get into the city.
14806985,Andrea,5,"Easy to find, easy to get into. We were able to find a parking spot on the street out front and because we arrived after 9pm and left before 8am, the parking was free. Neighborhood is safe. The bath tub is HUGE! There is a great Thai place across from the camera shop. Best Thai I've ever had, plus, they made us a take out order 10 minutes before closing on a Sunday night."
14806985,Eric,5,"Nice place to stay. Good location near downtown Toronto, everything is within walking distance. Lots of space and the bathroom is very spacious. Easy check-in and check-out process. Would recommend staying here."
14806985,William,5,Everything was just as expected.
14806985,Tj,4,This place definitely serve its purpose. Booked this last minute and was satisfied for a quick one night stay. Very responsive management. One thing I would say is you can hear almost anything in the apartment building/hallways.
14806985,David,3,"I found several items at the property to be sub-par. (1) Locking the thermost was not acceptable. (2) Not putting the towels in the bathroom was inconvenient. (3) The bathroom was clean but run-down with chipped tiles, missing shower door, adhoc tub access panel, etc.  (4) Lack of good clean drinking water options. (5) I really would have appreciated an iron for my dress shirt."
14820061,Andrew,5,Great place close to the subway! Would recommend
14820061,Liridon,5,"Zamaniâ€™s place was exactly as is described, clean, comfort and convenient location. Definitely we would stay again"
14820061,Savannah,5,"Best spot so far in Toronto. It was cozy, clean and quiet! Normally, I go to Airbnbâ€™s and they have really loud guests but we were the only ones. The Subway is a block away which was extremely convenient. It seemed to be 10-15 minutes from the city. I hope to go back soon!! Thank you, Zamani for your hospitality!!"
14820061,Adam,5,Enjoyed my stay there.  Everything was as expected.  I would stay there again. Adam
14820061,Sam,5,"Great location, clean and everything you need for a couple of days in Toronto. Would come back or recommend."

14874961,Jillian,5,"Great space, good location the only thing is you can hear people on other floors talking and walking around."

14874961,James,4,good spot
14874961,Jared,4,"Had a pleasant experience with this location, the management team was always helpful answering any questions that we had."
14874961,Corey,3,Awesome location right in the heart of the city! Construction all around that starts real early and the sketchy block right behind made a bit worse by the paper thin walls. Easy check in and out and beyond convenient for the city jus bring ear plugs.
14925943,Daniel,5,Perfect location and amazing balcony view
14925943,Victoria,5,The apartment was great! Very close to many things. The view is the best part!
14925943,Tamara,5,"Awesome view, cute place overall. Was wonderful for our weekend in Toronto. Fits two people perfectly"
14925943,Nathan,5,Amazing stay! Fast responses! As advertised and clean!
14925943,Candice,4,"This was like a hotel with an amazing view. The balcony portrays such a beautiful picture of the city of Toronto. Bed was comfortable. Place was very clean! Highly recommend Taverna Mercotto directly across the street from the condo! Excellent Italian food. Only con to this experience was that I felt important information were scattered between too many emails which was frustrating, however the host had quick replies to help remedy some problems I encountered. Overall worth it!"
15082256,Alaina,5,"Great place to stay while visiting Toronto! Very clean and comfortable with an amazing view. The host, Ev is very nice and responsive. Everything you need this place has! You will not be disappointed."

15188473,Gus,5,"Great people, great place, great apto, awesome location,  all went well with Joanna. Thank you for having us At your place, your hone has an excellent atmosphere"
15188473,Aleisha,5,"I enjoyed my stay here! Joanna was very accommodating with my need to check in early due to work time constraints. The apartment was quiet and private. We were able to cook our meals easily with all the necessary kitchen supplies provided. The rooms were nicely decorated and cozy! It was definitely a little home away from home! Joanna was quick to respond to my messages, which was so helpful for planning my trip. Thank you Joanna and Chris! Very nice to meet you!"
15188473,Maria Elena,5,Wonderful and cozy place. Loved the cleanliness and easy access in and out. Would definitely stay with them again.
15188473,Carolyn,5,Lovely modern apartment. Comfortable and very m ce

15235613,Ahmad,5,Place was really nice and very clean. A little complicated to find the parking spot but no biggie.
15235613,Brandon,5,"Great location that is central in Toronto. Clean, safe and was perfect amount of space for 2 people. Thanks!"

15239234,Aaron,5,Lauraâ€™s apartment is gorgeous. Amazing views from the top floor and balcony. Bed is comfortable and apartment is very clean. Bathroom is large and has a great shower. We had such a wonderful time staying there.
15239234,Tracey,5,"A perfect nest for a weekend in the city, right in the middle of everything!"
15362533,Joanne,5,Lovely clean apartment in a great location and Kevin was a wonderful host.
15362533,Maria,5,Kevin was a great host. He has done a great job at making sure the posting is as accurate as possible. He responds to messages promptly and accommodates any requests if possible. Location was good. Just outside of the centre of the city but about 15-20 drive to all attractions. Within a 5-10 minute walk you can get to many good restaurants as well. Thank you again!
15362533,Heidi,5,"My husband and I stayed at Kevinâ€™s place for three nights while visiting Toronto.  No issues or complaints.  Great space, good location outside of downtown.  Exactly what we were looking for and needed."
15362533,K. Soraya,4,"Nice space. For those inclined to cooler temps inside the flat, note that the A/C is controlled by the owner. Overall, good space in dynamic area."
15362533,Hanna & Marek,4,"The hosts were super speedy and polite  with all communications-tops. The neighborhood is charming and an easy two block walk to transit and cafes. The bed is wonderfully firm and bedding is super soft and lovely. I also appreciated the delicious organic cotton towels-very nice. So overall good.  To me, the photos make it seem both larger and more stylish/chic than it is. Though clean enough- it feels a little dingyâ€”maybe the plastic plants  and kitchen view of parking lot put me offâ€”feels like a finished attic â€”narrow halls ,smaller spaces than photos appear. Itâ€™s good for a longer stay efficiency apt.â€”not for a vacation feel of stylish getawayâ€”which is what I thought it was..."
15362851,Mark,5,Great little place just outside the city!
15362851,Tianran,4,Host lives on the other room of the same unit. Someone may not like it. Overall great stay
15362851,Maricruz,4,"I recommend this place as it is self Check in and the communication with Peter is easy, he is a kind person and replies quickly all messages. His apartment is located around 40 minutes in bus from the Airport and 40 minutes to Downtown using bus and subway. The building looks dusty on the outside but the apartment inside is restyled."
15362851,Monte Shiloh,3,"Peter was responsive to my messages, the place is a bit messy when i arrived. But overall it was good. 
 if youâ€™re  just looking for a one night place to stay i recommend this place"
15362851,Austin,3,"Overall, the stay was not bad although there were a few issues. Check in was a bit tricky because Peter needed to answer his phone to let us in and he ended up being away and had no cell service so we wouldnâ€™t have been able to get in if it werenâ€™t for slipping in behind someone who already lived in that complex. After the first check in though, we found a key fob in the room that let us into the apartment building, main room, and bedroom at any time which was very convenient. We arrived later than we originally told Peter and the room still wasnâ€™t changed/made/cleaned by that time. His brother came in shortly after we arrived and cleaned the room for us, but it should have been done on time. We were instructed to park in the parking garage, but you must use the key fob to open the garage and that wasnâ€™t made clear to us but we figured that out - there was only one space and there were other people staying here so it was up to chance whether we got a spot or not. Although there is guest parking, all the spots are pretty much always full we had to drive around many times hoping someone would leave until we got a spot. Location wasnâ€™t bad, although we had to walk about 30 min to get to where we wanted to visit in downtown Toronto. Definitely worth the price, especially if you are only staying a few nights."
15450150,Polly,5,Unit was clean and comfortable and as presented in the listing.  As others have mentioned towel amenities are still sparse.  Easy access to metro and possible to walk to dining/shopping. As in many cities a ride share or taxi at night is suggested.  Check in/out was simple and communications with hosts were prompt and courteous.   Value was good for busy tourist season...We would stay again if looking in this area.
15450150,Holly,5,"Great location, parking lot is directly across the street!  Place was extremely clean, well laid out and we exactly what we needed.  We only had one misunderstanding and that was on our part and the hosts we're extremely accommodating!"
15450150,John,3,Ok place
15450150,Stephen,3,The area is by a lot of good things to checkout. But itâ€™s also near an area which I didnâ€™t feel too safe walking around alone at night. I also wish they wouldâ€™ve let me control the temperature and would have provided more than 1 roll of toilet paper.
15450150,Chardonnay,3,"The location is great! We were within a fair walking distance to a lot of restaurants and shopping. The place was clean and comfortable. The only thing that made the stay a little awkward was each guest was only give one bath towel. There were no hand towels or wash cloths so there was no way to wash your face and body. There was also no paper towels, napkins or ice available. The ice maker on the fridge did not work and there was no ice tray. Overall it was worth the cost and we were satisfied."
15497982,Donna,5,"Outstanding unit! Clean, comfy bed, extra bedding and towels! in the heart of many attractions! Will definitely return. Only downside was overnight parking was expensive in the area. But the price we paid for our stay was beyond affordable for that area.. it all evens out."
15497982,Kevin,5,"My Fiance and I just spent the weekend here. The view and the balcony doors were amazing. The location is great. We could walk to get and do pretty much everything. We only used Lyft a few times for some specific things we wanted to do. If we every stay in Toronto again, we'll definitely see if this place is available first."
15497982,Ryan,4,"The location is perfect for navigating downtown Toronto! It was perfect for our long weekend away for a wedding at the local brewery. However our host was very unresponsive and while our issues were minor, no WiFi, I would be hesitant to stay there again in case we had an actual issue."
15497982,Dan,3,"The view is spectacular from the 55the floor! Smaller accommodations, but work nicely for two travelers. Be forewarned that the elevators can be tricky and can easily add 10+ minutes to your travel time if ordering an Uber."
15497982,Blake,3,"The unit is modern with an amazing view of the city.  However, given the high level of the unit, you need 10 mins to get in and out of the building (maybe more during peak times).  Bed was comfortable, but bathroom could be better.  Of no fault of the host, the building had no water on my first night there.  Overall pleasant stay, but did not think it was a great value."
15512850,Derek,5,"Great location, apartment was clean & in a convenient location. Would definitely recommend. Thanks Lina"
15512850,Meaghan,4,"The place is pretty accurate to the pictures. The view is the best part, I loved the open windows and the bathroom was a perfect size for a group of people getting ready. The place was not the cleanest but it was not dirty. Definitely worth the price."
15512850,Lindsay,4,Over all location was great & the host was responsive to messages. The key check-in & check-out process was really easy & convenient.
15512850,Matthew,4,"Great view and great location. Walkable to a lot of Toronto. Kid friendly and free parking! Some minor cleanliness issues like stains on carpet, on couch pillows, and on the shower curtain. Overall great place to stay."
15512850,Mohamed,3,Itâ€™s ok
15590063,Cameron,5,Great Place. Amazing View. Free Parking.
15590063,Stuart,5,Beautiful location with great sunset views from the balcony.  Vasily communicates well and the building has all the amenities you could ask for.
15590063,Bianca,5,"This was an amazing place for my boyfriend and I to stay! It was so clean, modern, and comfortable! Itâ€™s location was perfect for everything we wanted to do! I highly recommend staying here! The host provided clear and understanding directions and was always reachable! AMAZING!"
15590063,Jesse,5,Comfortable and as described. Two thumbs up.
15590063,Alexa,5,"My husband and I highly recommend!  Stylish, clean, stocked with the basics and consistent, clear and kind communication.   

The view of the city is cool with big windows

Be sure to follow Vasilys directions for parking carefully as it can be a maze in the parking garage."
15649505,Maria,5,Jay's apartment was wonderful. The check-in check-out process was very easy. The apartment was very clean and wonderfully located. Jay's responses were very timely and even bought a pack-in-play for our infant. I would highly recommend Jay and his apartment.
15649505,Faith,5,"All in all, it was a great stay! The apartment was perfect for five women - location, number of rooms, easy check in, comfy beds AND sofa bed.  Jay was very responsive to all our questions and very helpful in giving recommendations for transport and places to see during our stay."
15649505,Amber,5,This space was great! Jay was super helpful and our stay went smoothly. The space was clean and had everything we needed in a key part of the city. We will definitely look up this spot again when we are in Toronto!
15649505,Jacob,5,"Jay was fantastic. Quick responses, eager to help in any way both with the room and with tips for the city."
15649505,Erin,5,"Perfect location for attending a conference at the convention center. I stayed here with 4 coworkers and it was a comfortable and affordable stay. We loved the gym, hot tub and rooftop pool amenities!"
15699861,Patrick,5,Great spot to stay in
15699861,Thomas,5,"Great location, nice spacious apartment, clean, nice host."
15699861,Lanna,5,"Super comfy lived-in second story apartment a few km from city center! Place was decorated super cute for halloween/fall. 
 Rolyn was extra responsive and great DVD collection to cozy up to. Thanks for the great stay!"
15699861,Dylan,5,Very clean and cute little second floor apartment w a beautiful little back deck. Walking distance to almost anything you need. Rolyn was very nice and explained everything thoroughly. Would def stay again!
15699861,Christopher,4,"Rolyn was very nice and accommodating. We had a bit of an issue in communication with check in so I wasnâ€™t able to check in until a bit later, but Rolyn was accommodating. Rolyn provided his number after this and communicating was much easier. The place itself was cute with a lot of collectors toys, DVDs, and even a disco ball. It was very roomy for two people. One thing that I was disappointed about was no WiFi. It did say this on the Airbnb page so it is my fault for not checking but I usually just take this for granted (this is the first Airbnb I have stayed at that didnâ€™t have WiFi). Also no Netflix but there is a nice assortment of DVDs. However, given the location and price, I think it is a good value and Rolyn is a nice host, even though the communication prior to arrival could have been a bit better (although this was definitely a mistake on both of our parts)."
15701100,Josilyn,5,A great place to stay ! Thank you!
15701100,Leslie,5,Toronto was a great place to visit and the location was convenient.
15701100,Lynn,5,Lovely apartment that offered a view of the city. Good location.
15701100,Philip,5,Amazing location. The place is super nice. You are able to grab an uber in seconds and go to where you need to go.
15701100,Joe,5,"Lena & Dimitri are amazing people! If I had a question about something, they were easy to reach, & Dimitri even contacted me to answer my questions and gave me some places that were in the general area which I thought was extremely thoughtful."
15903030,Eric,5,always a pleasure staying here
15903030,Ahmed,5,It was nice I would definitely go there again if I could!
15903030,Anthony,4,"nice place, very clean, near local bars and clubs location was good right next to the city within walking distance"
15903030,Daniela,4,Great location!
15903030,Kiran,1,"Everything about this location was a bit disappointing. We found ants in our room, the island in the kitchen was extremely sharp and dangerous, there was extremely old coffee grounds leftover in the coffee machine, the dishwasher was broken, the kitchen exhaust was broken, the extra bedding was locked up in a closet. I did not have a good experience at all."
15970302,Danny,5,"Easy check-in, excellent host, lovely place, and perfect location. Couldnâ€™t have asked for a better stay!"
15970302,Holly,5,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. Great location!  Super comfortable space!  I would stay here again.  Love the self check in.
15970302,Jeff,5,Thank you for your kindness and hospitality. It meant the world. I wish you infinite success and wellness.
15970302,Melissa,4,"Good stay, good value, fairly good location. Was in town for work and the space worked. Chris was a good host, very communicative."
15970302,Frank,3,Location was ideal!
16101094,Connor,5,Mercedeh is the most genuinely nice host I have ever stayed with.
16101094,Jake,5,Easy check in and great communication! Awesome value for the private bedroom with bathroom in the room. Comfy bed and the place was very accurately as described and pictured. Very close to distillery district and not a bad walk to heart of downtown. Would stay again!
16101094,Kristen,5,Mercedeh is amazing! She and her husband are some of the nicest people. I stayed in a bedroom with a private bath and it was a great size especially just for me. I mostly spend time out of the house as I was only in Toronto for a few days and I wanted to see as much of the city as possible. Anytime I was coming or going either she or her husband would offer me some coffee or tea or something to eat. Any question that I had about how to get around they would answer. She is also a lovely person to chat with and she has the kindest soul. The area is actually very central to a lot of areas such as The Distillery District and downtown. Very easy to navigate around the area. I highly recommend staying here if you are taking a vacation to Toronto. The bedroom was sparkling clean and spacious. Also her location is in a safe area as I often walked by myself in the evening and it's easy to navigate around. I highly recommend this location for travellers.
16101094,Zihe,5,"Mercedeh is a wonderful host. My flight was delayed and arrived in the middle of the night, yet she greeted me and offered me food, water, anything I wanted. I really appreciate all her help. Her house is in a great location, an easy walk to the St. Lawrence Market and downtown attractions."
16101094,Bob,5,"The host was helpful with communications and welcomed a late check-in. Nice room and I was treated like family.  Thank You,"
16109795,Keith,5,"Very very clean , Great location centrally located to everything. Had a great time , truly recommended ."
16109795,Patrick,5,Absolutely fantastic. Awesome location and very friendly and quick hosts.
16109795,Jason,5,A&Câ€™s place was in an incredible location and was perfect for what I needed in my business travels.
16109795,Morgan,5,It was a great location to be able to walk around toronto and it was very clean.
16109795,Randi,5,"Andreanne and Carole's apartment is exactly as advertised and in a fantastic location -- close to the restaurants and amenities on King Street and the subway at Union Station. It is super clean, the beds are super comfortable, and it is super equipped with everything you need. Bonus: From the balcony you can glimpse the lake. My colleague and I were in town for a conference, and were well-equipped for work and rest, between the wifi and take out food and the supreme quiet of the apartment itself. Andreanne was immediately responsive to any questions we had. I highly recommend this apartment to anyone coming to Toronto for work or play!"
16113662,Earl,5,Excellent place to stay when visiting Toronto. Very nice area with lots of restaurants nearby.
16113662,Heather,5,My stay at Shauna's place was great! The location was perfect for walking to various areas of Toronto while also feeling like I was in a neighborhood rather than right in the middle of touristy areas. Plenty of great restaurants and coffee places nearby plus a grocery store if you'd rather cook at home. The apartment has everything you need to feel at home and was also super clean. Would stay again next time I'm in the city for sure!
16113662,Scott,5,Great place in a fantastic location.  Very responsive host.
16113662,Shahira,5,This place is awesome! Close to everything. The spot is located near tons of local bars and restaurants. Convenient to everything in Downtown Toronto. The host was quick to respond to all my questions. Easy check in and out; I would stay again.
16113662,Klei,5,"We stayed here for a few days at the end of September and couldn't have been happier.  Our flight was late getting in from the West Coast and Shauna was great keeping in contact to make sure she was available when we finally were finally able to make it to the property.

The property itself was perfect for my wife and I, as we were only staying for a short time.  It was located next to any number of great places to eat, and it was extremely easy to get around town from.

I would definitely recommend Shauna's place to anyone coming to Toronto.  Thanks again Shauna!!"
16271333,Michael,5,Wow!! What an amazing location!! Awesome views off the balcony of the entire city. I had a perfect stay here
16271333,Kyle,5,Very clean space that was steps away from the Scotia Bank Arena. Great communication and we enjoyed our stay! Highly recommended.
16271333,Monil,5,I would definitely stay here again
16271333,Oscar,5,"Unit was as advertised; clean, quiet, reasonably priced, and with a gorgeous view and ideal location. Hosts were totally accessible through the Airbnb application and responded promptly to every inquiry. My wife and I were only there for several hours so really didnâ€™t have the opportunity to enjoy our stay. Exceptional value."
16271333,Elaine,5,"Great little apartment with a balcony and terrific view. Honestly couldn't have asked for a better location. Check in was really easy, she left us really good instructions and even had little videos showing how to navigate through the lobby (it's a big building). Really excellent stay."
16391394,Marlee,5,"This was my first time using Airbnb, so I was a bit nervous. Getting recommendations from Jennifer, chatting day-of check-in, and seeing her place made me feel instantly comfortable. I would recommend this stay to anyone traveling to Toronto, and I hope to be able to revisit!"
16391394,Thudo,5,Clean and nice place for two.
16391394,Henry,5,"If you're going to be traveling to Toronto I'd definitely recommend booking your stay at Jennifer's place. I found it the perfect little spot to just hang out. It's walking distance to a few bars, very close to Casa Loma, and easy to navigate to further distances.
Jennifer was very helpful and accommodating throughout my (short) stay. This was my first time in Toronto, let alone Canada but felt right at home. In fact, it was hard to explore the city as I almost preferred to just enjoy the neighborhood and house itself!"
16391394,Cassy,5,"Such a cute house! We felt cozy, comfortable and taken care of while staying at Jennifer's. We loved the decor and comfy bed. Everything was clean and it had all the amenities we needed and then some - thanks for the tasty beer! Speaking of, being able to walk to nearby Blood Brothers Brewing was a huge a plus for us! Communication was also great, especially considering we booked at the very last minute after being stranded in Toronto an extra day. Jennifer was happy to welcome us and had the place ready in about 20 min! She is a very kind host who made us feel better during a stressful day away from home. We are thankful for Jennifer's hospitality and would certainly stay again!"
16391394,Sharila,5,Wonderful place near the heart of Toronto. Very quiet and comfortable. Would definitely recommend.
16456277,Nicole,5,The views and location were amazing! The apartment was perfect for my stay and I will definitely be visiting again.
16456277,Angel,5,They apartment was amazing & very clean. And the view was just beautiful! I would definitely recommend this to anyone visiting Toronto & would stay here again.
16456277,Mark,5,"View is amazing, place was very clean, central location. Everything was as advertised."
16456277,Sarah,5,Amazing location with even better views! Just what youâ€™d need for a weekend getaway. Zain was very responsive and the place was just what we expected! Would definitely stay here again if I found myself back in Toronto.
16456277,Jason,4,The view is amazing. The hosts are extremely nice and answer quickly to any/all questions you may have
16480550,Jacob,5,Exactly what we needed for a quick trip to Toronto. It was very clean and decorated nicely. There is also a metro  line right outside that will take you downtown. I would definitely stay here again!
16480550,Nicole,5,"Absolutely loved staying in Heatherâ€™s space, it was clean, cozy and in a great location. My sister and I are already making plans to come back!"
16480550,Sarah,5,"We stayed for one night to attend a concert at the Budweiser stage. We were very close, we even walked. The location was amazing. At first we were kind of scared because the outside of the building is a little run down but once inside the apartment we were pleasantly surprised with the space and the cleanliness and even our safety. The space is very cute and bright and the bed was comfortable, I would definitely stay here again!"
16480550,Magdalena,5,"It was a really nice stay and everything was like we expected it to be. 
We liked Heatherâ€™s place and would recommend it!"
16480550,Shane,4,Convenient and cheap
16600799,Vanessa,5,"Great value at a great price! Cozy, clean, chic and very close to transportation. Not to mention a wonderful Portuguese bakery around the corner I frequented rather often, during my stay. Cesar is also a quick communicator. I would stay here again."
16600799,Sudeep,5,Great place to stay and not too far from the center of the city.
16600799,Logan,5,Cesarâ€™s place was perfect for us. It was near a lot of great food spots and about a twenty minute drive to downtown Toronto. Cesar was super responsive and super friendly. Next time I come to Toronto I will book Cesarâ€™s place again.
16600799,Preston,4,"This was a decent place for the price. The ceiling is especially low so for tall lodgers you may want to think strongly about this. There was a parking spot in the driveway which was nice transportation wise. If you are not bringing a car, there is a metro station 20 min away by foot. The bedroom is right behind a boiler room so there is a loud noise throughout the night. Overall pretty good."
16600799,Audrey,4,"The place was great if you're on a budget. It was a little annoying to sit in traffic for so long to get into the city, but you get a full kitchen and the place to yourselves so its a trade off. Also if you're a light sleeper just know the bed shares a wall with a utility closet and the water heater turns on in the middle of the night.  Overall  though it was fair for the price and very clean inside."
16709255,Kristopher,5,Wonderful location and view of the city. Itâ€™s close to everything we wanted to do. I would stay there again!
16709255,Christy,5,"If you are looking for a spectacular view, amazing host, and with in walking distance to almost everything you could want this place is for you!!!  We had a wonderful time and Cherry was absolutely lovely and extremely helpful with anything we needed."
16709255,Cloie,5,"Cherryâ€™s place was perfect for a little weekend girls get away! The view is insane and the whole place was so clean. The place had perfect amount of room, and the location you canâ€™t beat! Would totally recommend!"
16709255,Mary,5,Amazing views! Clean and fully equipped apartment. Centrally located in the midst of plenty of action. Cherry was very accommodating and helpful. A great value for a getaway!
16709255,Cara,4,"Overall, we had a great experience with Cherry. She was very quick to respond and the check in and check out were very simple. 

The views in the unit were amazing! Location was great and very convenient for getting anywhere in the city.

It would have been nice to have some extra towels (we had 4 small towels for 4 people), top sheets, additional linens, and bath mats. There are no curtains of any kind on the large living room windows. The sun in the afternoon is very intense and makes it difficult to sit in the main room. If you are sleeping in that room you will definitely want a sleep mask.

We had a wonderful trip to Toronto!!"
16779632,Symphonie,5,Andreanne and Caroleâ€™s place was amazing! It is the perfect location to stay in for Toronto! Space is clean and there was a nice gym we used which was a god send cause it was raining the morning we wanted to go out in a run. Nice perfect spot to stay and the host was super responsive!
16779632,Jessica,5,You get what you see! This place is a GEM! Very central and very chic! Would love to stay here again.
16779632,Brooke,5,I personally did not stay here. I booked this spot for my parents 30th wedding anniversary. My parents loved the place. Close distance to food and entertainment. Quick response times and very helpful with recommendations for the area. I recommend this place for sure and hopefully one day be able to visit
16779632,Ashley,5,Highly recommend if staying in Toronto! Location was fantastic and in walking distance to so much. Condo was very clean and communication was great.
16779632,Ryan,3,Great unit in the heart of Toronto.
16795828,Nathan,5,This is the most beautiful space to stay in. It was a peaceful restful spot and we loved every minute of it. If your in Toronto there is no other place you should stay!
16795828,Haley,5,"What a wonderful place to experience downtown Toronto. Very responsive guests, the place is truly unique and quirky."
16795828,Jake,5,"Gwynâ€™s BnB is a must for people who prefer to have a place to unwind at the end of a long day. The beautiful plants, interior design, and all the natural light really made for a comfortable space. Thereâ€™s a small reading couch right next to one of the windows that is perfect for a book or a cup of coffee. The hosts are very attentive and responsive and my overall experience was wonderful."
16795828,Kit,4,It was a beautiful place that made me feel entirely at home. I only wish that I had been able to stay there longer.
16795828,Erin,4,Cool space!
16838562,Austin,5,It's a great place to stay if your working around the area.
16838562,James,5,Mike is very helpful and great in communication.
16838562,Jacob,5,"This place includes everything that you would need for a stay in Toronto. Itâ€™s close to public transportation and downtown. It provides most basic amenities one would need. Quiet home in a quiet neighborhood. For the price, you canâ€™t top it. Had the pleasure of meeting Mike and he was also such a fantasticly friendly host. 

If I am lucky, Iâ€™ll absolutely be back to Mikeâ€™s place on my next visit to Toronto. Looking for the best deal possible? Go no further."
16838562,Selda,5,Mike was kind and very helpful. I always reached him when I needed. His place is clean and comfortable and it is very well-organized; you can see all the information you need in related places. The location is quite good; it is not very close to the downtown but very easy to reach through the subway. I also like the neighbourhood. The only problem I could say is about the air conditioner. It was too noisy.
16838562,Will,4,"The place is nice, but be aware there are numerous other people renting the other rooms at the same time. Still, this place is a steal. For the price point and location, you can forgive the cosmetic defects in the house and the lack of the host's physical presence. All ammenities were accounted for including a nicely fitted bed, a desk, Wi-Fi, and a community kitchen. Would visit again!

For those desiring a hotel quality suite, though, look elsewhere and increase your price point."
16839171,Arkeif,5,Convenient and very comfortable
16839171,Bingying,5,Pretty great place to stay for the price.
16839171,Analie,5,"Michal's place is quiet and a great deal for the price. The room with the balcony and kitchenette offers a lot of privacy and if you're looking to chat, Michal is friendly and willing to give suggestions on what to do in Toronto. Close to Davisville station, which is on the TTC 1 line, but if you're looking to get outside of city center, there are plenty of restaurants to the north of the house, and it is easy access to the Moore Park Ravine and the green spaces around Don River."
16839171,Redmond,5,Was in a great location and overall was very easy.
16839171,Susanne,5,"I totally enjoyed the stay at Mike's place. Found everything I needed right away!
The neighborhood is very safe and beautiful with plenty of food stores and small restaurants. Very easy access to public transportation.  Room was clean, equipped with a kitchenette, no stove, but could use the stove in the kitchen downstairs.  A nice touch were free coffee, tea, spices etc.  Actually, everything I needed was there. Had to share the bathroom with a few other people but never ran into problems with that. Everything worked out well. Felt that the bathtub was not sparkling clean but must admit that I am a clean freak.  Would definitely stay there again! The guests were absolutely delightful!"
16884840,Christopher,5,"Beautiful place with an amazing view of Toronto. It was a wonderful stay, Renata was a great host and check-in was smooth."
16884840,Andreina,5,Such a wonderful place to stay with AMAZING views!
16884840,Thomas,5,Great space and perfect location!
16884840,Stephanie,5,"Loved my stay here, details given on how to get in made everything super simple. She had everything we could need in the appointment from toothpaste to popcorn. I loved the view and the bed was nice and comfy :)"
16884840,Jessica,5,This place was great with an amazing view. The host was extremely responsive and helpful as well.
17047357,Vlad,5,"Very good place to stay, close to city centre"
17047357,Lyndsey,5,Very clean and great host!
17047357,Ethan,5,"This place was great for a weekend trip to Toronto. Itâ€™s in a great neighborhood with shops, cafes, and restaurants and very close to several subway stations. Overall, it was very clean and comfortable in a neat apartment building with parking which was a huge plus. We would definitely stay here again!"
17047357,Linda,4,"The stay was quite pleasant. The only thing I want to note is the ceiling in the bathroom looks like it could fall down if there is any slight movement upstairs. The ceiling at the entrance also looks like there was some kind of fire that had happened beforehand. It is blackened at the corner. None of these affected our comfort though. We slept very well at night, and the place is very conveniently located. We would definitely stay here again."
17047357,Samantha,3,Good location !
17088112,Michael,5,Great place!  Awesome communication!  A nice place to stay!!
17088112,Denis,5,"Place has terrific access, especially if you're taking the train in from Union Station.  Instructions for check-in were clear and easy and Jennifer did a great job of communicating in a timely manner. I would highly recommend this place!"
17088112,Jennifer,5,So cute for 2 people traveling to Toronto. We went to a concert at Scotiabank Arena and it took less than 2 minutes to walk there! All kinds of grocery stores are nearby and the patio has a partial view of the lake. I would stay again!
17088112,Devin,5,The apartment was perfect for a short trip and location was just amazing for what we wanted to do while in Toronto. Would absolutely stay there again if in Toronto.
17088112,Carol,2,"If you need only a double bed, this unit is fine.  If you need two separate beds, this unit is inappropriate.  Also, entering  into the unit without being stopped and questioned by security may be a problem.  I donâ€™t believe I was ever been in touch with the â€œownerâ€ Jennifer.  It seems the real owner of the unit was another fellow.  Each time I called, I got different person.  It seems that the unit is managed by a company.  The people who worked for the company were very helpful but one needed to call during working hours."
17157293,Dale,5,Airbnb has been really good with sending information prior to check in and what the area is like and watch expect on your trip and has a lot of great ideas
17157293,Ahmad,5,clean and roomy
17157293,Pepe,5,"This place is great all around: Setting, dÃ©cor, cleaniness, amenities, location, communication with the host and value. 

The unit is exactly as described and the pictures show. Great location with accessibility to main roads, subway station, pubs, restaurants; and on a very quiet street.

I had a great stay and would definitely consider this unit again on my next trip to Toronto.

Thank you."
17157293,Ed,5,This was our first time in the city! This location is absolutely perfect for touring the city and was a convenient distance from everywhere we wanted to go! The apartment itself was very welcoming and had so many amenities we felt right at home! Would highly recommend for anyone!
17157293,Seth,5,"Very clean, cozy home that is a great place to stay while in Toronto. It was very close to down town but also tucked away in a quiet part of town which was nice after a long day in the busy city."
17240473,Menachem,5,"Paul's space was perfect. We'll situated, very clean, and so full of light!"
17240473,Jaaron,5,This was a great place to stay. Sparkling clean and in a perfect location. I really enjoyed my stay.
17240473,Steven,5,Place was in a great location and was perfect for two.  The patio is a great place to view some of the city skyline.  Parking and checkin were easy. Would definitely stay here again.
17240473,Maben,4,Great host who is super attentive and the unit is spotless.  Great location and comfortable. Very modern.
17240473,Jeffrey,4,"The location is terrific; plenty of restaurants and services nearby including a grocery store in the same building. Subway access is a block away. So, the condo is a great base for exploring the city without the need and hassle of a car. (The included parking spot is a big plus.) The condo space itself is pleasant; very light and open. The condo furnishings could use an upgrade; the kitchen table stools, couch and chair - while newish - are cheap and uncomfortable. Also, the outdoor deck patio needs furniture; it isnâ€™t much of an amenity without the ability to sit down. But we were there to explore the city, not to lounge around the condo. So, it worked well for us."
17478687,Olga,5,"Max's place is in a wonderful location, stylish, super clean, affordable. All this is top of Max being a stellar host who goes out of his way at every opportunity to make your stay as great as humanly possible. This has been one of the best AirBnB experiences I've ever had."
17478687,Salinah,5,"If you are looking for a place that is a affordable and nice, while also not being to far from the city this is the place you are looking for. You are right in front of two bus stops and not that far from the subway station. ( I suggest day pass instead of wasting money on Lyft) Max is very welcoming and any question you have about the city, where to eat, or general question he will answer quickly and help ease your mind while on the trip. This was my first time in Toronto and by the end of my trip I felt like Maxâ€™s place was mine I felt so comfortable in his place and commuting around the city. The apartment is located in a very diverse area so you have the chance to eat food from all over the world and meet really nice people."
17478687,Leonel,5,"Maxâ€™s place was very clean, just as advertised, and he was very responsive and attentive host."
17478687,Alex,5,"Maxâ€™s place was very comfortable and clean. I was in Toronto for a conference at one of the big (expensive) hotels downtown, and this was a perfect place to crash and get a good nightâ€™s sleep. It was easy to get downtown on Torontoâ€™s public transit, and Max gave very helpful and detailed instructions for how to get to his place from the airport. There were lots of food options in the area, too."
17478687,August,4,"Max is a great host, very capable and willing to help out for whatever you need!"
17682332,Karlyn,5,I had a great time! Beautiful place- good bang for your buck :) would recommend
17682332,Misha,4,"Great, clean place, but makes you feel a bit isolated and has no human interaction."
17682332,Akarsh,4,It's was a pretty good stay. The room was clean. Finding a parking spot was a bit troublesome.
17682332,Jay,4,A nice place to stay!
17682332,Sam,3,"This was sadly my greatest AirBNB let down.  The place was very barebones, cleanliness was passable but lacking, and it just didn't have any elegance or even a simple but home-like comforting atmosphere. 

Please be aware this property is shared amongst many others.  This is not a personal home with a few guests.  Also note private parking spot is not guaranteed as it is shared between several guests.

Would recommend if price and convenient location are your ONLY concerns, otherwise we would recommend looking elsewhere."
17682376,Amor,5,Very nice host. Other guest in the house are quiet. Very close to lots of restaurants and itâ€™s a very beautiful room
17682376,Laura,5,"Very clean space, good for a short city stay. Thank you!"
17682376,Brenda,4,This is a very beautiful room inside a large house and there is plenty of privacy. It was very clean and easy to find. The only thing would warn future guests about it that it does face the road so you can hear every car that drives by all night long. It is also directly across from a track field with VERY bright lights that are on all night and illuminate the whole room (which made it a little hard for us to fall asleep).
17682376,Anthony,4,"Good place for a good price. Easy check-in and very clean place. However, the walls are thin and the Wi-Fi is unreliable."
17682376,Samantha,3,Great location in the middle of everything and close to public transportation. There was a soccer game at the school across the street that was loud and went on until about 11pm. This room was right on the street making for a night awake.  It was great to have wifi but I was unable to watch hulu or netflix because the wifi was poor. The owners did a magnificent job of communication and letting me know where to find clean linens for the bed.   Only being able to whisper in a room was a little ridiculous but the walls are so thin I could see why. This place was great for the night that I needed it as a solo traveler. If you are a hard sleeper this would be a great fit.
17682453,Peter,5,Great place and real close to everything downtown.
17682453,Tania,5,"This place is very close to down town, lots of stores, restaurants and bares near by. at my arrival the place was very easy to find  very safe even at night. So nice to walk around, subway and public transportation is right there. 
Place is very clean,  easy instructions to check in and out. 
Very happy stay, two big thumbs up!!"
17682453,Anu,4,Paperbox mgntâ€™s place has a great location and is really clean. Although the walls were thin hosts responded quickly to solve the issue.
17682453,Vrunda,2,They do not provide basic amenities in the kitchen (like bounty) and in bedrooms (like hangers). The place is extremely noisy at night. Once the bathrooms in all floors were extremely dirty and the host took more than 2 hours to clean them. They provide very little value for the money they charge.
17682453,Juana,1,"absolutely gross room , there was mold in the bathroom , spiders , mosquitoes, and iam allergic to them horrible pictures I took compared to the ones posted."
17682560,James,5,Nice cozy space. Was a good place to stop and sleep as I was out and about in the city.
17682560,Aja,5,"If you're looking for a great place to stay in Toronto, this place is it! Just a few minutes away from Downtown Toronto. Very easy transportation options all around. The room looks exactly like what you see in the photos. The only bad comment that I have about is the room was that the bed was a little stiff, there were some nights I had a hard time sleeping. The bathroom is very clean and nice. Checking In was no hassle at all,  the host gave amazing directions and instructions.  The WiFi wasn't the greatest at times, it did lag a lot but not a major issue since most of your time should be spent out of the house. You do share this household with other travelers which isn't a big deal. I didn't run into the other that much but when I did, they were all very friendly. Overall, this stay was by far amazing. If and when I come back to Toronto, this is where I'm staying."
17682560,Richard,5,"Great location, clean bright space. Host was very understanding when I made a mistake in booking the wrong dates. Appreciate the prompt and helpful communication."
17682560,Kathleen,4,"Clean room, nothing fancy, but everything tidy and useful (good reading lamp, towels, etc).  Great communication from hosts.  Easy walk to the subway."
17682560,Elizabeth,2,"Cons:
This is a crash pad: 8 rooms of guests (16 people approx for 2 bathrooms)
Paper thin walls (can hear everything)
Bed is very plastic sounding when rolling over
Parking: if you get a spot in back (only 2) it is good. If you donâ€™t, youâ€™re SOL
Worst pillows Iâ€™ve ever had in my life
Very strict rules
Someone rang the doorbell for 10 mins straight at midnight. When messaged the host about it, they blew us off like we didnâ€™t matter. 
Right on a noisy street; no central air or air flow (no fan) so had to have window open and heard loud street noise all night. 

Pros:
Location close to restaurants and coffee shops. 
Clean and bathrooms well stocked
Across the street from a free running track that was very nice

Overall would not recommend except in a pinch for a night"
17682585,Remington,5,Good stay. Great value for location.
17682585,Vitalii,5,Decent stay for that money.
17682585,Lauren,5,"The room and house was great, clean stylish modern. This is not a typical house situation as it is a house but run more like a hostel. The owner does not stay there, itâ€™s only guests. That said we read the reviews and knew exactly what to expect upon arrival. 

The room was as shown, although the room on the recons floor was quite hot and the bed was very uncomfortable. We were also warned via the standard email to guests that you could â€œonly whisperâ€ inside the house and any noise complaints would result in extra charges. While a bit off putting, this did result in a relatively quiet stay while we were there and we werenâ€™t kept up at night by any other guests. 

Also, the â€œfree parkingâ€ is a bit misleading. There are only two spots in the back for upwards of 6 guests at any given time. Both were taken the entire duration of our stay. Luckily we got dropped off so we didnâ€™t have to deal with finding alternative parking as I didnâ€™t see any around. 

All around if youâ€™re looking for a decent accommodation in an up and coming neighborhood just outside of the city youâ€™ll find it here. We should also mention that a lot of surrounding properties to this one are boarded up (it seems like this area is just started to become â€˜gentrifiedâ€™)."
17682585,Peter,4,"If you are looking for a basic room to spend the night, this is the one. I will most likely book this room again."
17682585,Matthew,1,"The WiFi did not work, coming from the US I could not use my cellular data and therefore, could not access the internet the entire stay.  The ""free"" parking is also a joke.  6+ cars need to fight for 2 spots.  Good luck.  I will never stay here again."
17682704,Philip,5,"Perfect for a day or 2 in the city. Whether visiting friends at the University of Toronto or just in town to explore the city, this space offers you everything you need at a good price."
17682704,Jayesh,5,Good place to stay ! Location is great.
17682704,Bizhong,4,"Good value for the price. The particular room facing the street is a bit noisy. Other than that, great!"
17682704,Demeara,4,Nice place. Its central cooling so if possible try to have a place closer to the ground floor. Really nice area
17682704,Ornella,3,"House is clean but rooms are much smaller than they appear in the pictures. WiFi did not work for the 4 days I stayed there. I called the host multiple times and the issue was not resolved. There is AC in the house but not in the room, just a little table fan. Overall it wasnâ€™t a bad stay. However, host should work on posting information that accurately reflect the unit."
17682721,Daniela,5,"Itâ€™s a really good place, location, room and bathroom clean."
17682721,Catherine,5,Room was exactly as expected.
17682721,Arjun,4,Great location. It's clean and convenient. The only problem I felt was the noise. The walls are too thin and it gets noisy. If anyone is moving around in the night then it can easily wake you.
17682721,Neil,3,"Fine for a single night stay, although felt more like a college dorm than a B&B."
17682721,Timothy,3,"Cons:
-Thin walls, bring ear plugs
-Slow wifi
-Room wasn't clean when we arrived, even though we were later than expected.
-Photos not completely accurate
Pros:
-Good value
-Good location
-Responsive host"
17682741,Mason,5,"Nice place, good location, and great communication"
17682741,Azzam,5,Great place if you are needing to crash. Location is wonderful for site seeing. Everything is nearby in walking distance. Parking is hit or miss as you can't reserve but there is a parking lot in walking distance with a flat nightly rate. Street parking depends on the day of the week but can work out to ones schedule if needed. Overall very nice and comfortable place to stay!
17682741,Joseph,5,"Very easy checkin, great location! Room was perfectly small for just the two of us."
17682741,Emily,4,"Great for my 1-night trip!!
My room was clean, comfortably warm, the house was quiet and the location was AMAZING for convenience to my plans on Bloor. I suggest you bring your own pillow, and know, the onsite parking is tight."
17682741,Mark,4,"Very simple and easy check in experience. The common area and kitchen is perfect and extremely comfortable. Shared Bathrooms are lovely and not a problem to use at all. The bed and space was comfortable and lovely, only thing to note is there is no AC so visiting in the summer months requires the window to be left open. WiFi also doesnâ€™t function extremely well in the bedroom but the common area is adequate."
17775203,Bryan,5,"clean condo, location was perfect for me, very easy check in/out"
17775203,Gary,5,Ideal location.
17775203,Tara,5,This is a great spot. Perfect downtown location. Very clean. Large gym area for your morning work out. Just all around a great find. Wish we could have spent an extra night!
17775203,Tiffany,5,"Great location, amazing price. Speedy communications. Smooth check-in and out. Amenities are key. Will rebook."
17775203,Joanna,4,"Sean's condo is centrally located, clean, and in a great building. Would recommend if you're looking for an easy, comfortable place to stay for a work trip to Toronto."
17777800,Thomas,5,Wonderful spot in a great area - strongly recommend!
17777800,Athena,5,"Shawn's place was perfect for my work trip! It was super conveniently located and easy to get to. I walked everywhere and found this to be a great neighborhood. The space is well laid out and had everything I needed, including laundry. Shawn was communicative and helpful when I had questions. Would stay again!"
17777800,Jarred,5,Thank s
17777800,Alexandra,5,"All about location with this one! I stayed here while I was attending a conference. I had to come in early to help set up and then stayed a few days to attend.  It was all within walking distance and a great walk every time. Awesome food and restaurants super close to the listing, and a supermarket literally half a block away. I slept like a log and enjoyed the gym in the building. Internet was fast and I loved the little balcony. Thanks for a great stay!"
17777800,Erich,4,"I was in town for business for a night, and Shawn's place was a great alternative to a hotel at a much better price. Excellent location, clean. I probably would choose a different place if I were with my family, as it's more like a hotel, less like a home, but for a solo business traveler for a night or two, it's perfect."
17787008,Brilanda,5,Perfect location. Right by the CN tower and aquarium. View is gorgeous in person and we enjoyed our stay. Highly recommend!
17787008,James,5,Josephâ€™s place was very clean and near to downtown. I stayed here during a work trip and felt very at home. The buildingâ€™s gym is really nice to be able to use. The view from the room is awesome.
17787008,Sandy,5,Great location. Super soft sheets!! Seriously ... super soft! Slept like a baby!
17787008,Brooke,5,"This was a fantastic stay in a beautiful location. You can walk the whole city from here. Extremely convenient for anyone with events at the convention center. It does say the couch can sleep one, but it is extremely uncomfortable and not recommended. If you need to fit two people, you can squeeze in the super comfortable king bed, thatâ€™s the best bet!"
17787008,Peter,5,"If you're looking for a clean, safe, stylish place to stay while in the heart of downtown Toronto, look no further. I couldn't recommend this any higher than I have. The place suited my needs perfectly. 

Check-in was a breeze and as described. The building is a very secure building and never did I ever feel unsafe or out of place. The apartment had an unbelievable view of all of downtown with large glass windows throughout.

Everything is literally minutes from the front door; dining, entertainment, train, etc.. I will without a doubt look to book Joseph's place on my next stay."
17832256,Mathieu,5,"Good location in Koreatown with lots of options for food and drinks. Very clean. Good communication, making the check in and check out process very easy."
17832256,Elliot,5,This was an amazing experience for me. I was staying in Toronto for two days and needed a cheap place to stay. Frank and Kelly offered their home at an amazing price. Everything was clean and as listed. Great spot because parking and shopping are less than a minute away. I will be coming back and reccomend anyone in the area to try it. Also say hi to the other guest you will meet some cool people!
17832256,Jeff,5,"Cozy room, quiet, nice bathroom, and not too far from where you wanna be!"
17832256,TÃ­ara,4,Overall I highly recommend this place. The cleanliness and communication are top-notch. It's in a great location with lots of restaurants and shops and things to do nearby. The room is perfect for two and even better for one.
17832256,Lukas,4,"Convenient location in the heart of Koreatown/The Annex. Short walk to Little Italy, Kensington Market, ROM, and other destinations. Convenient municipal parking lot next door. The space was clean and well-maintained with easy self check-in."
17855818,Rayel,5,"We LOVED Nick's place. It was sparkling clean, the appliances were gorgeous, the shower, bed, and over feel of the place was comfortable and minimalistic but also eclectic. El Pocho's was delicious and right across the street! Overall, good time. Thank you for having us!"
17855818,Ana,5,"Perfect location, very clean place."
17855818,Katie,5,Everything at this airbnb was wonderful! The nespresso machine was a nice added touch. Very clean and full of character. Would recommend to anyone!
17855818,Mary,5,"This place was just the peaceful getaway we were looking for! The location was perfect for my husband and I, and we are looking forward to coming back in the future. Thank you for making us feel at home in Canada. They were super helpful and flexible, giving us a chance to truly enjoy the city. Thanks!"
17855818,Stephan,5,"Nick's place is charming and homely. Very clean, neat, and comfortable. This was a great place to return to after a busy day."
17971401,Suriel,5,Jerry has the best view of Toronto!
17971401,Cliff,5,"Great location and great view, very comfortable space, very responsive host."
17971401,Danielle,5,"Jerry's place was AMAZING! Check-in  was very easy! The place was extremely clean. The view is great! You can see part of Lake Ontario. Jerry was very quick to respond when we were having roku issues and he was able to help fix it. 

The apartment is centrally located and in walking distance to almost everything! The apartment is located off of Spadina and King, both are main roads, that are great to walk along. Spadina takes you to Chinatown and Kensington Market in minutes. Another luxury to being centrally located is the streetcar, which runs on both Spadina and King.  There is free parking, which is rare to find in Toronto. The CN Tower is about a 10 minute walk and there are so many great restaurants near by! Jerry has a blog, which was helpful for food suggestions.  My husband and I would definitely stay again!"
17971401,Winston,5,Loved the space. Incredible view. Quiet building. Comfortable bed. Great part of town with lots of good dining options. Host was very responsive. Iâ€™ll be booking here my next trip to Toronto.
17971401,August,5,"Wonderful location and host! My sister and I spent 5 days here and the location is unbeatable. Jerry was always accommodating and responsive and the condo was very clean. The extra office space proved very convenient for luggage storage and the only challenge we faced was one mirror with two women. A full length mirror in the bedroom would have saved us a lot of time. Overall, great experience and would definitely recommend staying here!"
17979234,Roshan,5,Great place and host.
17979234,Brandon,5,"Richard was a great host and his place was perfect for my stay: spotless and comfortable and in a great location downtown.

I would highly recommend his place!"
17979234,Lily,5,Loved staying in this beautiful city apartment. Great location with a communicative host. Sparkling clean and comfortable furniture. Thank you Richard!
17979234,Elliot,5,If you are looking for a great place to stay while in Toronto look no further. I stayed here on a recent business trip and you could not beat the location. I forgot my toothbrush at home but sure enough the host had a brand new toothbrush ready just in case this happens. The entire check-in process was very easy and the host was very quick to respond to any questions I had. I definitely recommend staying here if you are in Toronto.
17979234,Veronica,5,"Richardâ€™s Airbnb was exactly as pictured and described - and then some! The space was clean, well though out, so comfortable, and perfectly located. Check in and check out was seamless, and Richard is very responsive and attentive. I look forward to staying at his place again the next time Iâ€™m in Toronto! I highly, highly recommend!"
18009897,Vishal,5,amazing place to stay
18009897,Stefan,5,Thanks
18009897,Anna,5,"Great spot! Super clean, quiet, and the hosts were incredibly attentive. Close to the streetcar lines and walking distance to Dundas Square"
18009897,Nina,3,"The stay was good overall. The only thing was that the kitchen wasn't clean and there was this closet next to the bed with some sort of machine in it, the machine made a lot of noise and did that the whole night. So if you're a light sleeper, I wouldn't recommend."
18009897,Christina,1,"Well for starters .... it's located in the middle of the slums in Toronto. The Pictures posted DO NOT accurately depict the stay. The main door was just a push lock something typically seen on a bathroom door with no external lock. There were mutliple dents, holes and dings on all of the walls, as well as a film of dust on all of the appliances. The pictures posted glamorize this hole-in-the- wall dump, my friends and I ended up canceling upon arrival and getting a hotel. If you want to stay in a unclean, noisy shack for a night then this is the place for you !!!!"
18154899,Adam,5,"We had a great nights  stay at Andrews. The unit was very clean and comfortable. One thing to note is the extremely low ceilings, watch your head... Other than that it was fantastic. Would recommend."
18154899,Justin,5,"Andrewâ€™s place was a nice, cozy spot. Itâ€™s conveniently located with plenty of food options nearby - as well as plenty of stores for pretty much anything you may need to grab. The waterfront is close by and downtown Toronto is only a 10-15 minute drive as well. I would stay at Andrewâ€™s place again in the future."
18154899,Lauren,4,"Stayed at Andrew's basement for one night, good communication and check-in instructions were clear. The bed was comfy and the couch area next to the bed is spacious and comfortable as well. Everything was clean, the only issue I saw was the driveway leading up to the entrance down to the basement, rubble everywhere. The host should fix this issue right away before winter when the surface becomes slippery."
18154899,Chad,4,"Very clean and neat. Only note, it's a downstairs suite with some noise early in the morning from above."
18212525,Mona,5,Really clean and convenient space! Itâ€™s in a great location. Shalini is a very responsive host and made sure we were happy.
18212525,Debbie,5,"Really clean and modern space, Shalini was very responsive as well. Definitely recommend!"
18212525,Mona,5,Great location! Super clean and Shalini is a very responsive host.
18212525,Megan,5,"Actually a really nice place in a cool part of town, newly renovated and unique. Would definitely go back"
18212525,Lara,5,"Arriving at Shalini's place kind of felt like finding a secret clubhouse. The nondescript door is to the side of a restaurant supply store, so you have to watch for it as you might accidentally walk right past it, which we did a couple of times over the course of our stay. There is a staircase right inside the door that you will have to carry your luggage up, so pack light! Once you get to the landing, there are three units. This one is on your right. The space is so airy with high ceilings and surprisingly quiet given that you are on a really busy street. The kitchen is adequately appointed. The only thing missing is a coffee maker, but there is an amazing coffee shop two doors down called Strangelove Coffee. We started our days there, so didn't even miss having our own machine. There's also a Starbucks across the street if you are looking for something a bit more pedestrian. The neighborhood is funky and eclectic with an amazing assortment of restaurants. You don't have to go more than a 10-15 minute walk for every type of food you can imagine. We enjoyed Early Bird Cafe just down the street for a light breakfast, Cauldron Ice Cream across the street, Portland Variety around the corner and down a couple of blocks for another breakfast option, Fahrenheit Coffee for another great coffee option, De Men Bistro (a brand new Vietnamese restaurant),  Montgomery's and Lee's Restaurant for more upscale choices, Ramen Isshin for amazing ramen... ALL within a 10 minute walk and there were SO many other options!

Parking is a bit of a pain, but we found that parking at the Shoppes at Queen West on the corner  of Portland and Queen Street W was the best option. It's an underground lot and is $20CAN a day. It's well lit and felt very secure, better than the outdoor lots located around the neighborhood that are $19CAN a day. You can only park on the street from 7pm - 7am and you still have to pay for that, so we found it easier to just park in the garage most of the time. 

When we arrived, we had a few random issues that were not at all Shalini's fault... Just a crashed modem and an air conditioning unit on the fritz. Both issues were addressed quickly and professionally. The AC took a couple of days to resolve, but we were provided with a fan and were comfortable enough despite the heat wave. The beds were very comfortable! My son slept in the loft bed and really enjoyed having his own space. I slept down below and, again, was so very impressed with how quiet it was. The unit has a washer and dryer as well as a dishwasher. We did not use either of them, but they are there for your convenience. All in all, the apartment was very comfortable and Shalini was a great host! We will definitely check into staying there again the next time we are in Toronto."
18254263,Jillise,5,"Awesome space! View is stunning, host is great and replies very quickly to any questions. Location is stellar - I walked most places I wanted to go. Love the amenities. I'd stay here again for sure."
18254263,Helen,5,"We loved this cozy, clean and stylish space! We got to enjoy the pool and hot tub and everything was in walking distance! (We are New Yorkers so walking a mile to Aquarium is NBD). Great places to eat and plenty of parking! And just a really cool - neat space! Wish we could have stayed longer!"
18254263,Jacque,5,Stylish and safe in the big city. Johnny was prompt to reply and accommodating to our needs.
18254263,Peter,5,Highly recommended!
18254263,Jessica,5,I had a quick business trip and this was a great and affordable place to stay. Johnny is a very responsive and thoughtful host.
18405740,Melissa,5,This place is amazing. It's beautiful and clean. I felt very safe and it is in a great location. Mila was an excellent host and answered all of my questions very quickly. Would highly recommend!
18405740,Alexis,5,"Five stars for location, got to walk everywhere we wanted to go. Very cute apartment, super clean and the host is great. Definitely going to come back and highly recommend staying here!!"
18405740,Samantha,5,"This place is perfect if youâ€™re going with you significant other. I went with my hubby and we both loved the place. We were able to walk everywhere and cook , bake and have a wonderful view and so much more. Only issue was that the blanket to sleep with had stains but she was quick and came over and gave us a new quilt which made it more comfortable. Other then that the place was clean and i loved the view. She was a great host and very quick to responding if we had questions or any issues. I would book again!"
18405740,Cory,5,N/a
18405740,Viktoriia,4,"Expect to walk in the room and feel like there is an earthquake going on! Everything you touch will be unbalanced, I was afraid to lean on the dinner table, because I thought it would collapse. Also if you plan on taking a shower, plan on cleaning up from the person who used it before you. Oh yeah and also there is a washer and dryer in the room you shouldnâ€™t really need that usually for a little trip but in this room you will because the bed was dirty dirty and it was kinda of annoying having to clean in after driving all the way there and wanting to lay down. The tv remotes. Oh man try to guess which one to use..also the sensor remote was dead and i had to use my own charger because there wasnâ€™t one.. you wanna eat or use any of the stuff there is you will have to clean it because it most likely will be dirty..other than that everything was great. The view was beautiful and the room itself was nice just should have been a lot cleaner.
P.s. if you donâ€™t half the city seeing you naked you might want to ask to get the blinds fixed and also the pictures are a little outdated should probably get those updated!"
18507725,Stephanie,5,Just stayed here for 4 days and it was exactly what we were looking for. Very clean and cozy. Joshâ€™s mom was very welcoming and friendly. This place was also a super close to public transportation (subway) in and out of the entertainment district! Perfect stay. Thank you!
18507725,Sam,5,"Josh's place is super clean and comfortable. Location is great with lots of good places to eat, super close to downtown. Check-in was easy too. Would recommend 10/10."
18507725,Monica,5,We were staying at Joshâ€™s place to attend a conference at the University of Toronto. It was spacious and the kitchen was helpful. There is also a grocery store just a block away.
18507725,Meg,5,"This was the perfect place! Clean and bright, right in the center of everything we needed. Two subways stops just a short walk away. Grocery store just down the block, great local food places in walking distance. Josh was great! Really quick responses when we had questions. If we ever make it back to Toronto those is the only place weâ€™ll stay!"
18507725,Antonio,4,Nice and clean place. Grocery store is very close  and subway station at about 10 min walking distance.
18548770,Kinohi,5,"Comfortable studio in a prime location in Toronto. Walking distance to all the spots I needed, and some of the best eateries are nearby. Would stay here again!"
18548770,Ron,5,"Nat and Jay are awesome! A very well organized check-in and check-out process, free parking space, clean and well equipped space with full amenities (i.e. cooking utensils, stove, washer and dryer and etc...) The hosts were very quick to respond to any questions or simply follow up to make sure you check in and out smoothly. The balcony gives a beautiful view of downtown especially at night! I will definitely rent this space age with Nat and Jay and highly recommend for anyone that wants to visit and stay in the heart of down Toronto."
18548770,áƒ¦å°è˜‘è‡Ë˜âŒ£Ë˜ C),5,"This is my first time travel to the Toronto so I was looking for a good location that could be easier for eat, shopping and transport. This apartment is amazing and I'm very satisfied. So I'm really recommend this place!"
18548770,Katie,5,"Great location, good kitchen supplies, cozy, clean"
18548770,David,4,"I came in town for a realestate conference.  The place was great and only a 5 minute walk from everything.  Id stay here again.
David"
18630892,Selma,5,It is a very nice place with a beautiful view   And great location. I will stay there again for sure.
18630892,Bryson,5,"Great place to stay in a very nice building with a lovely view. Check-in and check-out couldn't have been any easier. The location is perfect, walking distance to almost everything and easy access to transit for everything else."
18630892,Caroline,5,"Amazing spot in downtown TO, super close to everything! Super easy check-in process, quiet, clean and comfortable. Loved it!"
18630892,John,5,Great location for work or play in Toronto. Check in/out process was easy and hosts were available and responsive. Iâ€™ll definitely use again.
18630892,Dmitri,5,"This place is in a great location, right next to the CN Tower, with lots of restaurants and bars nearby. My favorite part were the amazing views from the balcony! The apartment itself was modern, clean, and very comfortable."
18736782,Jerry,5,Great location and very nice apartment.  Daniel was very responsive to questions.
18736782,Maggie,5,Great location. Danielâ€™s place is clean and has everything we needed. Quick response to our questions. We really enjoyed the stay!

18736782,Hamza,5,"Great location! A must place to book when in Toronto. Only blocks away from CN Tower, Downtown Toronto, and Old Toronto. Instructions were clear and the place was spectacular. Couldn't have asked for anything else."
18736782,Lindsay,4,Great location. Had everything we needed for a quick overnight in Toledo.
18776150,Dane,5,Awesome
18776150,Caroline,5,"Great location, great value, and great host!"
18776150,Steve,4,"Great place with all the main amenities you need, location is right in the heart of Toronto. Everything is extremely close and walking distance."
18776150,Ali,4,"Great location. Walking distance from the Rogers Center, Scotiabank Arena, TIFF festivities (what my friends and I attended for), and basically everything downtown. The space itself is well kept, but not particularly spacious. Comfortable for 2-3 people, a fourth would have to share the futon or sleep on the floor. But for the price, oh so fabulous!"
18776150,Erica,4,"Excellent location in the heart of downtown, right next to CN tower.  Small space but clean and cozy, and walking distance for so many Toronto attractions. Would definitely stay there again!"
18812517,Yuning,5,Great place to stay!
18812517,Jarrett,5,Shawn was a great host! A great place to stay.
18812517,Kejdi,5,Great place and great hospitality!
18812517,Sergio,5,"What a fantastic stay! We were attending the ImagineNative Film Festival at the Bell Lightbox. We stayed here with our entire family (3 adults and 2 little kids) and it was perfect. Close to everything we needed including a 24-hour grocery store and the venues for the festival as well as close to trains, and other touristic attractions."
18812517,Enrique,5,We stayed for a night in Toronto and the space was amazing. The whole experience was awesome actually. Thank you
18848374,Rachel,5,"This place is exactly what one person needs  and a great location and amenities, totally recommend."
18848374,Ravin,4,Good place in a great location. Check-in process could be better but all in all a good place to stay near everything you could want.
18848374,Cody,4,Great views and location. Check-in was a little unclear and was a hassle but once we got checked-in then it was fine. There is parking nearby. Good value for price.
18848374,David,4,Location was great. Right in the middle of downtown. The condo was clean and neatly kept. Space was limited - as expected in a downtown condo. Did get the impression from host that the condo is not suppose to be on Airbnb but no-one bothered us.
18848374,Jordan,3,This was a very B+ accommodation. But that was expected. I didn't like how we had to sneak past security. Otherwise the place was fine
18856610,Alika,5,MJ is fantastic. He is super nice and took very good care to make sure everything was in order.The place is very clean and nice. An absolute steal
18856610,Yannen,5,"I love it!! Very clean and beautiful apartment, the host are very kind."
18856610,Alex,5,"Beautiful, CLEAN, and centrally located!! Had a wonderful time, very easy place to relax after running all over Toronto!"
18856610,Jamal,5,Mjâ€™s place was very nice and cozy and perfect for our overnight stay before an early morning flight at Pearson. It is about a 10 minute easy drive without traffic to the airport. Very roomy and clean with the right amount of amenities provided. Will def be staying here again. Mj was very attentive and quick to reply.
18856610,Alex,5,"Great place for great value. We checked in late because of flights, but check in was easy and had zero hiccups. The place is clean, quaint, and cozy."
18893052,Sean,5,"Exactly as described, had a wonderful stay. No complaints!"
18893052,Matthew,5,"Nice area, good host!"
18893052,Guillermo,5,"So wonderful hospitality! 

Highly recommended!"
18893052,Justin,5,"Great space for 7, easy to find and check in. Would stay again when in Toronto."
18893052,Hedieh,5,"Everything was good , clean , near to downtown"
18993947,Alysha,5,Helenâ€™s place was an amazing place to stay for our girls weekend in Toronto. The view was absolutely spectacular!
18993947,Brandon,5,Excellent place to stay in Toronto! Highly recommend!
18993947,John,5,"I love Helenâ€™s place, this was a return visit.  The view from the high floor is very cool, check in is super easy, the location right next to Union station with grocery store across the street is super convenient, and Helen is super responsive on communication.  I had such a positive experience, thank you Helen!"
18993947,Matthew,5,"Helens place is amazing! When I walked into the Airbnb, what caught my attention was how clean it was! Everything was perfect! The view is amazing, and the parking was not too hard to find! I enjoyed every second of the apartment while I was in there! If I could give Helen 10 stars I would! If youâ€™re going to stay in Toronto and you want a CN Tower view! Thereâ€™s nothing better than Helenâ€™s apartment! I will definitely be staying here again!"
18993947,Sue,4,"Spectacular views!  Windows all around and we were on the 51st floor.  Having floors and no carpet is a welcome sight.  Kitchen is lacking a few things if you are eating in.  Location is great to Union station, bus stops, (Website hidden by Airbnb) Tower right outside your window!  Pretty clean space and nice floor plan for 2 couples.  Seating not so great for our husbands but we made do."
19202117,Dan,5,great apartment and great location.
19202117,Neeraj,5,Excellent apartment and ideally situated close to great restaurants and the Path. Will definitely stay here again.
19202117,Cory,5,Close to everything downtown.  If you arrive late there is a 24 hr food mart on the same block.  Lots of space in this 1 bedroom  unit compared to other similarly priced studios downtown.
19202117,Josef,5,Convenient location.   Clean and simple.
19202117,Daniel,4,"I think one of the best things about this place is that it is centrally located downtown. You are only a few minutes from Osgoode Station (which is a stop on the subway system), you are close to the main train station (Union Station) and you are only a few blocks away from Queen Street West, which has the streetcars, and has a lot of great restaurants and shops (record shops, shopping, etc.). Also, once you come out of the building there is a 24-hour shop around the corner where you can get basics (water, milk, eggs, cheese, cold cuts, etc.) at any time of the day or night. The bed is comfortable, and the shower has great water pressure and lots of hot water. You are about 16 stories up, so you'll be somewhat isolated from the street-level noise, although this is a bit city and you are downtown, so you'll get some noise. There is a coffee maker and an electric kettle in the kitchen, which was nice for early morning coffee. This is not a luxury condo, but it is a good apartment where you can stay and have access to all things downtown. One point I feel I have to mention is that we were told not to use the front door of the building, and to walk in through the back (through the parking garage). I think if you come by car, this is probably no big deal, because you're going to park in the garage anyway, but we came in by train and were on foot and, had we known we couldn't use the front door, we would have rented elsewhere. But other than that, we had no major objections."
19317016,Jude,5,Great
19317016,Jenna,5,Within a short walk to the bus line as well as a lot of restaurant options. The bed was as plush as a cloud. Having a washer and dryer in the unit was a nice touch too. Great space!
19317016,Fernando,4,"Very nice clean modern place with very nice heated floors. Great host, easy communication."
19317016,Cherise,4,"When staying, the room its bigger than what I thought. Very spacious and clean. My favorite part was the kitchen!. George was a great host, helped us whenever we needed with the train/subway, local resturants and more. I like the quiet location and it wasnt in the heart of Toronto but with a train away you were right in the heart of Toronto. Great location!"
19317016,Kadeem,4,"George's basement apartment was a lovely space with great lighting . The bed was super comfortable. Everything in the apartment looked recently updated and was very clean. The neighborhood was very safe and close to nice restaurants and bars. George had great recommendations for great bites like Emma's Country Chicken and Pain Perdu, George was very responsive and I definitely would stay here again if I come to Toronto."
19662741,Sophia,5,We had a great time staying at Helens place. It was in the perfect location surrounded by restaurants and shops. The place was great with a beautiful view of Toronto. Would recommend this place to anyone!
19662741,Kelly,5,"We had a great stay at Helen's condo.  The location can't be beat.  Within walking distance to Roger's Stadium, Scotiabank Arena, Union Station and lots of great restaurants.  The view from the 59th floor was STUNNING.  The place is clean and had everything we needed.  Remember to book your parking ahead of time.   Helen was super helpful and responded very quickly to all my questions.  Would highly recommend."
19662741,Russell,5,Beautiful sky rise condo right in the heart of downtown within walking distance to all of Torontoâ€™s best attractions ! Helen was so helpful even though I booked last minute. She was fast to reply and confirm my booking. The view from the condo is absolutely amazing and made our trip extra special.
19662741,Jessica,5,loved it! it was perfect as always! this was my third stay. helen was super easy to contact when i needed her and she always replied back right away and was super helpful with what i needed! i definitely look forward to staying again!
19662741,Wayne,5,"Great view, comfortable, highly recommend."
19694550,Anthony,5,"Great place, close to the tram and bus. Perfect for my trip."
19694550,Mina,5,"Beautiful house, nice host. Good stay:)"
19694550,Danielle,5,Great stay! Did not get to meet Elena but Jim was wonderful and had great suggestions. Check-in was easy. The room was very clean and bed comfortable. Bathroom was clean - shower wasnâ€™t quite hot but warm enough to get by. Overall a nice stay. Location is 20-30 minute walking distance to main downtown.
19694550,Maria Filipa Seara,5,The location of the place is great. Central and has some really good coffeeshops around. The place was really clean and super quiet and overall nice. the hosts were really nice and understanding of the fact I arrived late due to flight delays.
19694550,Kim,3,"Elena was great with communication and Jim was very hospitable during check-in.
The private room/bath was clean and conveniently located pretty close to downtown (I felt very safe walking in any direction, even at night). However, the condo is older, and the soundproofing isnâ€™t great. I was woken up every night at 5a when Elena got home from her overnight shift since their room is on the floor above."
19698563,Allyson,5,"A+ view of the city and CN tower, free parking and nice place."
19698563,Margaret,5,Canâ€™t beat the location and free parking.
19698563,Jobanveer,4,Great view
19698563,Grace,4,The perfect locations with a great view. There was a ton to do nearby and we walked everywhere except for one Uber late at night. The complex is huge and we had some confusion with security but were fine after working that out. I think a stay before us must have thrown a party as the walls were banged up and had some black scuff marks on it. Furniture and bedding all clean however and we learned to ignore the marks as we spent most of our day out exploring.
19698563,Liang,4,The room has good view but only basic furnitures.  Overall it is ok
19831971,Stanley,5,Loved my stay at helens place simply amazing!!
19831971,Eunice,5,Great view. Convenient location. Picturesque interior. Loved it.
19831971,Diane,5,Great location with fabulous views of tower & harbour!
19831971,Gideon,5,"We had a great stay at Helenâ€™s apartment in Toronto, comfortable, clean space. Spectacular view as advertised. Helen was quick getting back to me when I had questions. Had a very nice stay with my family in Toronto. Definitely recommend."
19831971,Reece,5,Thanks Helen for the lovely stay! Such an amazing view and could not ask for a better location! Would 100% stay again
19839950,Jamie,5,Nice area!
19839950,Amanda,5,"Awesome space, great people! Super cute and clean - and comfy bed!"
19839950,Joe,5,Great stay! Super kind and knowledgeable with the absolute best recommendations.
19839950,Ima,5,"Lovely home, very clean and cozy. I enjoyed my stay here! I would highly recommend this place for others!"
19839950,Stephanie,5,"I can't recommend this place highly enough.  It was in a super convenient location, clean, and Am was an excellent host.  She was very proactive in providing information and super responsive to any questions I had."
20010119,Muhammed,5,Great spot to stay when in Toronto.
20010119,Brandi,5,Lidia's place is in a great location. She is great at quick communication and check-in was a breeze.
20010119,Bilal,5,Amazing host very clean place and great communication!
20010119,Suzanne,5,"Cozy is the word for it â€” this room is small. But since I didnâ€™t need it for practicing my floor routine, it was quite comfortable. The wifi is good, there is a power strip for computing and charging, and you have your own entrance. I didnâ€™t use them, but there is also a dresser and a TV. Hooks for even heavy winter coats are in the room, along with a mat for shoes and complimentary slippers to use. There is a kitchenette available, with a kettle for boiling water ready to go. While the bathroom is shared, I never noticed anyone else using it (great water pressure, too!). It is very clean, and I found the bed to be very comfortable (I prefer a firm mattress). The pillows have a firm side and a soft side, to appeal to everyone. There are some drawbacks: the path along the side of the house to your private entrance isnâ€™t all well lit (I used my phone flashlight) and the gate catch at the top is a little tricky from the outside. You canâ€™t flush toilet paper, which may put off anyone who has never been outside the US and Canada, but wonâ€™t phase world travelers. The parking is by neighbourhood permit, so itâ€™s best to go to the Toronto City Hall site and purchase a temporary permit (24-hr, 48-hr, or one week), and print the permit off at home before you come. Itâ€™s $11CDN, as opposed to the $50 ticket you get if youâ€™re parked after midnight without one. I didnâ€™t know that and it was a little inconvenient to get it done once there. The location is excellent, about a 3-4-minute walk to College Street (where you could also park), where there are some great restaurants. I was in town for an event at the Mod Club Theatre, and I was so glad I had a brief walk back to my cozy room and not a drive back to Buffalo at the end of the night. Lidia and her family could not have been more welcoming, and it was a pleasure to stay in their home. I would definitely go back next time I have an event in that area."
20010119,J.,4,"Location is excellent and Lidia very kind. The place is near all, but on a quiet street. Comfortable back of house unit with great access. Will definitely come again!"
20011209,Michael,5,"Great location, minutes from downtown Toronto. Space is exactly as described."
20011209,Anthony,5,"Very nice apartment for a great value. Hosts were very helpful with recommendations on things to do in Toronto. Overall, a great stay!"
20011209,Rani A D,5,Highly recommended. You wonâ€™t regret booking this place.
20011209,Guillermo,3,"Nice and well located place, definitely recommended"
20011209,Katja,3,"The place itself was great! Small, but very clean and new. However, the location was less than desirable. It was not as close to downtown as stated (definitely couldn't walk) and it was located in a grungy area that I did not feel safe walking around in."
20094311,Kendra,5,Great spot! Very walkable. David is a really nice host.
20094311,Drew,5,"Absolutely fantastic flat! To start, the location cannot be beat. Placed right in the middle of Old Toronto- you are in easy walking distance of Rogers Centre, Scotiabank Arena, CN Tower, the Distillery District, Toronto City Airport and so much more. In addition, the flat is gorgeous and the view is incredible. One of the best AirBnBs I have stayed at and highly recommend."
20094311,Yixiao,5,"I spent a very nice week at David/Lydiaâ€™s condo. Great location (close to waterfront/grocery/subway), beautiful view, very clean room and fast wifi. Communication with David was seamless - he is very easy to be reached when there was a brief power outage and proactively reached out for an emergency water shutdown. The only minor suggestions I have are 1) it would be helpful to add a couple of hooks in the bathroom and 2) would be nice to fix the warped floor in the hallway."
20094311,Andy,5,Davidâ€™s condo was super stylish with a tremendous view of Toronto from the 63rd floor. Very easy check-in and out process with easy access to all areas of the city.
20094311,Donnie,4,Host was great!
20316532,Brandi,5,Excellent place! Would definitely stay again!
20316532,Amanda,5,"Staying at Holly's place was awesome. From the self checkin, to the killer AC in the unit we loved it. This place was in a 5 min walking distance to major public transport and was super close to some sweet retro video game stores. Would def stay here again on our next trip!"
20316532,Wilson,5,"Hollyâ€™s place was very clean and the self check in was very easy. Their private parking made it very easy for us to travel around Toronto. Overall, a great stay and highly recommend this place for a short or long stay as Holly provides outstanding hospitality."
20316532,Raymond,5,First off I would like to say that the location was very convenient and clean. When we arrived we met Holly and James. They were very friendly and attentive. Holly's place has all the amenities you will need for a short stay or a long stay.
20316532,Jordan,5,A beautiful and clean place. Has all the amenities to live there for a few days like silverware/plates and spare toiletries. There were some donuts left in the fridge for us and a binder of local places to visit which was a big plus
20437221,Adin,5,The view at Joannaâ€™s place was wonderful and the location is very hard to beat. Great find.
20437221,Kevin,5,"This is an especially good place for business travelers. Close to the financial district, it really is a few minutes to Union Station. The WiFi is high speed and for those who care, it has actual cable TV (lots of sports and news channels), not Roku with no broadcast channels or live sports. Thereâ€™s even a printer and if you forget anything, small toiletries you typically find in a hotel. This place is comfortable, clean, nicely decorated, lots of sunlight with a lake view. I would definitely stay here again."
20437221,Wesley,4,Stylish place in heart of downtown. No Parking in area. Good spot to be if you are just using in the unit to sleep and have access to good areas in Toronto
20437221,Michael & Katrina,4,Great location.  We walked to everything. The building and condo felt very high-end.  The views of the Lake was a plus. We enjoyed drinking our coffee and watching the sail boats in the Harbor.  It was a great stay in a great city.
20437221,Annie,2,"Great location, beautiful condo. But thatâ€™s about it.  Communication was HORRIBLE.  We arrived and had no toilet paper, and no paper towels or napkins to substitute. My friend had to use a tissue pack she brought and we also stole toilet paper from a bar and brought it back to use.  I messaged the hosts both on Airbnb and private text, and it took so long for them to respond, and when they responded finally they asked me if I was sure there was no toilet paper in the place, and I had checked every closet and nothing.  Then they said theyâ€™d bring it to me in the morning, and Iâ€™m like thatâ€™s so not worth it because we check out in the morning.  Then finally the host asked if they should bring it that night, and I said yes and thatâ€™d be ideal, and then I never heard from them the whole rest of my trip. Rude. What horrible service.  No toilet paper... come on.  Not worth $200 a night for no basic necessities. Also there was stains on the carpet in the bedroom."
20442832,Moin,5,Awesome service I will recommend everybody
20442832,Matt,5,Ling's place is in a great location in downtown Toronto in a secure building. Great view of the CN tower from the windows.
20442832,Stacy,5,"Views were spectacular. Price was great. Very good communication. Would possibly be difficult to navigate check in if you were a single traveler with a car, but doable for two or more."
20442832,Bre,4,So close to everything! Great views of Toronto.
20442832,Timothy,1,"We stayed for a night at Ling's place for our anniversary and were excited to visit. As soon as we entered the apartment, our nightmare began. The apartment was definitely not maintained nor regularly cleaned. We should've known that this was going to be a terrible stay with bad hosts when we were told to communicate with someone else via text and email that would send us instructions and provide any help that we needed outside of the Airbnb communication channels. Here's what we experienced during our stay along with a forced midnight cancellation after an 8 hour dispute and request for a refund.

As soon as we arrived, we noticed that the shower handle was missing and the only way to turn the shower on and off was using a pair of pliers directly on the valve. There was also black mold forming along the base of the tiles at the top of the tub where the shower controls and head was located. The towel holder was also ripped out of the wall and holes were left in the drywall.

The walls in the entire place had black scuffs and damage. Aside from the beautiful view outside of the floor to ceiling windows of the CN tower, there were lots of plastic blinds missing, which let direct sunlight into the apartment and directly into the bedroom that was open to the living room area (like a studio apartment).

In the bedroom, towels were left on the bed for our use. When we took the towels off to lay on the bed, we noticed a dark brown stain on the bed. We also tried to close the bedroom off to the living room using the large glass sliding partitions, but one of the partition's rollers was broken and out of the track.

Overall, this was a nightmare of an experience and it was unfortunate because the apartment is in a fantastic location with a beautiful view. With actual maintenance and cleaning, this would've been a better experience and review."
20620905,Birgit,5,Our family of 6 came from California to visit family and see Toronto. The home fit out needs. Brent is a gracious host and was there to greet us and answer any questions. We all enjoyed our stay. We would definitely recommend Brent and Loriâ€™s place!
20620905,Abbie,5,"The home is beautiful and has every amenity you could possibly need for a successful trip! Brent and Lori keep the home spotless, complete with extremely comfortable bedrooms and well kept bathrooms . 10/10 recommend and will very likely return!"
20620905,Huiyuan,5,"Brent and Lori and really nice and location is in the middle of North York and York, convenient for us to visit the city."
20620905,Tanzy,5,This is a great space for bigger groups! Brett and Lori were super quick to respond and very helpful!
20620905,Frederic,5,Brent and Lori were wonderful hosts.  We arrived very late on a Friday and Brent was up late and again early on Saturday to make sure we had everything we needed including the parking permit needed to park a rental car.  The house is charming on a quiet street.  The rooms are super comfortable - a nice place to rest and refuel from hectic Toronto.
20696761,Sarah,5,"Room was exactly as advertised. Rainbow was a great host, very fun to talk to!"
20696761,Ashfaq,5,Affordable place to stay.
20696761,Kate,5,"Antonio & Rainbow are excellent people and are experts at hosting, providing all the info you need before you think to ask questions! Very kind and hospitable : )

If youâ€™re looking to stay here and commute into Toronto every day, budget for an easy enough 10-15 minute walk to the train stop (less fun when carrying luggage) & a CAN$5 fare. Looked like there was plenty of street parking available, if you have a car with you."
20696761,Aimy,5,"We only stayed for a night but had a great experience. Antonio greeted us upon checking in even though it was 1am. The room was nice and quiet and we slept well. It was easy to walk to the UP Station the next morning to get into the city.
Thanks for having us!"
20696761,Jennifer,4,Comfortable place and and very good communication with the hosts.
20801977,Donna,5,Excellent as described place to stay in Toronto!
20801977,Kevin,5,Gregory was great ! Awesome location with a beautiful view. Very clean and great natural light.
20801977,Katherine,5,"Gregory is so kind, friendly, and willing to accommodate. He went above and beyond to make sure that my stay in Toronto was enjoyable. The apartment has a spectacular view of Lake Ontario, and everything was very clean and stylish. Definitely going to book Gregoryâ€™s space if Iâ€™m ever in Toronto again!"
20801977,Meg,5,"I highly recommend Gregoryâ€™s place to anyone visiting Toronto, especially solo travelers looking for security and a great value. Communication was clear and quick. The accommodations were comfortable and clean. Gregory was polite and welcoming. Five stars all around."
20801977,Corinne,5,"Gregory was a fantastic host, my friend and I were very lucky to find this place on short notice. If youâ€™re looking for a clean, comfortable space thatâ€™s close to pretty much everything, this is the place to go. Canâ€™t recommend it enough!"
20803625,Hussein,5,The place was great and the location was awesome and the view was amazing
20803625,David,5,"Amazing place. Great views, clean, and at a walking distance to everything."
20803625,Matthew,5,"Good experience, excellent view and location, highly recommend this unit"
20803625,Stuart,5,Great location with a great view. Perfect if you are looking to explore downtown to Toronto...highly recommended
20803625,Susan,5,You want a view?  This is it!  We watched the sunrise and the sunset.  Great central location to all forms of transportation and activities!  This was our first visit to Toronto and we could not have planned a better location!  Thanks.
20865190,Brittany,5,Audrey was a wonderful host!
20865190,Viktoria,5,Great place. Very convenient and had everything I needed for my stay.
20865190,Kierra,5,"Very friendly host, had great recommendations about the town and great conversation"
20865190,Francisco,5,"Andrey's place was as advertised. Very convenient, parking spot, and had everything needed for my stay."
20865190,Seyi,5,"Highly recommend! A few minutes walk to a local grocery store thatâ€™s open late, and close to public transportation that takes you into downtown. The place is quaint and comfortable, and is near a nice park too! Would stay again!"
20902086,Ayano,5,thank you!!
20902086,Danielle,4,"This place was exactly as described and a great unit. It's nicely decorated with plenty of space to spread out (I had two people in my party and we had lots of space). It was nice having the bed and two pull out beds. There were lots of pillows as well. No extra blankets for the pull out couches though, though I had one in my car so we didn't bother asking for any extras.

The check in process was very easy with the lock box. We drove up from Rochester (NY) and there was plenty of street parking, though the price is a bit steep ($4 per hour). There's also a lot across from the property that you can pay to park in for ~$15 per day.

The location is okay. It wasn't immediately close to as many restaurants or other things to do as I was hoping, but it's close enough to other areas that you can walk or Uber to. There's also currently construction going on directly across from the property so there was a bit of noise with that.

The only complaint I have is that the wifi was not working upon our arrival at 4pm. I contacted PaperBox Management through the Airbnb app and while they responded quickly, they asked me to ask the renter in the unit on the third floor to reset the router. I tried, but there were no stairs leading up to the third floor that I could find (only outdoor steps to the main unit, which is not a rental I don't think), plus I wasn't comfortable bothering the other renter. I asked if they could contact them instead, and they did, but the guest was not arriving until around 7pm. I asked if someone from PaperBox could physically come out and reset the router in the meantime but they said it wasn't possible. It was finally fixed around 9pm when the other guest arrived, but I was surprised that there was only one router and it was in a different unit, and that someone couldn't come and reset it without the other renter.

Overall this was a good deal, but I probably would not re-book this unit in the future."
20902086,Chastiny,4,Great area
20902086,Frass,4,Good stay and very clean place
20902086,Eugene,4,Good value for the location.
20984414,Caitlin,5,"Clean space, great location, great value"
20984414,Michael,5,Nice apartment with an excellent location in the best part of downtown Toronto.
20984414,Hailey,5,"Frankâ€™s place is sparklingly clean and in a great location. The unit itself has everything you need and is on a very safe, private street.  I would highly recommend this stay, and I will definitely be booking again!"
20984414,Rosalie K,5,"Beautiful apartment, the perfect place to stay during your next trip to Toronto! We were so centrally located, and parking was easy. I highly recommend Frankâ€™s place to anyone!"
20984414,Jessica,5,"Beautiful, sparkling clean place in a trendy part of Toronto. Frank was easy to communicate with, and check-in was a breeze. There's a  bit of street noise at night, but it would only be an issue if you're super sensitive to street noise. It wasn't a problem for us at all! Lovely spot--would definitely stay here again."
21025345,Sonali,5,Amazing location and a super comfy place to come back to.
21025345,Mandi,4,"This spot was pretty cool. It was a bummer that the gym is right above this unit, so the 5am slamming of weights sucked. But I fell back asleep quickly. 

Itâ€™s a great spot to be close to downtown and has an amazing view."
21025345,Stan,4,A nice and safe building with great City views. Pool and Sauna. Perfect location for city site seeing and 2 blocks from Railroad Station. Easy access from the highway and plenty of available parking nearby.
21025345,Valeria,4,"Very nice location, great view from the room and a nice balcony. 
It was not as clean as expected but ok overall. 
It was kinda dark because most of the lights didnâ€™t work. 
Easy to go in and out."
21025345,Chelsea,3,"The air bnb is in a great location, however, for the amount of money you are going to pay,  it was not worth it. The apartment needed to be cleaned well and re painted. The bathroom had not been really cleaned in a long time, the couch has gross stains and the bed linen were made of pure polyester. Do not expect breakfast, everything was empty. Could be a great place is it was painted and cleaned."
21108565,John,5,"I stayed here for one night on a trip to Toronto with friends, and it was exactly as pictured. Perfect location right by all the main attractions we wanted to visit. I didn't realize that parking was not included with the stay, however, Sage and Saad were quick to give a recommendation for a lot that was less than a 10 minutes walk away which was incredibly helpful. Our stay exceeded our expectations and with such amazing hosts, I highly recommend booking here if you are thinking about visiting the area!"
21108565,Emanuel,4,Nice place in down town within walking distance of restaurants and entertainment places. Check in/out process a bit complicated. Heat doesn't work. Rates per night kinda high for such a small apartment.
21108565,Sara,4,Great space in downtown Toronto!! We enjoyed staying here but found the space to be a little small for four people.
21108565,Surare,3,Nice spot
21108565,Maria,3,"My stay at this place was not what I had expected. I had booked this place because of the reviews. We were hardly in the Airbnb but the walls were dirty, sheets were stained, and the communication was not the greatest. The messages I received seemed like they were copied and pasted. I always received a â€œcopy and pastedâ€ text before an actual response. I had an issue with the parking and they were kind enough to provide parking info for a public lot. I ended up booking their parking also for an extra fee and that was a process to say the least. I waited outside the Airbnb for 45 mins before it was resolved. They also did not provide an actual key so I had to download an app which I was confused about at first. I asked them how I could fix it and the first message they sent back was â€œread through the check in instructionsâ€. I hope I am just a one off case and that the reviews are accurate. Thank you."
21160812,Arif,5,"Very great location, stylish place, good amenities, easy check in instructions, amazing amazing amazing view of the CN tower!"
21160812,Mercedes,5,Lovely stay with a great view and great communication from the host.
21160812,Chase,5,"Great location, gorgeous apartment!"
21160812,AndrÃ©,5,"Great Stay, everywhere I wanted to go was very close & easy to get to.. perfect location..."
21160812,Evince,5,"Iris home was in a perfect location in Toronto, all the entertainment and restaurants you want weâ€™re pretty much walking distance or a short Uber trip around the city. I would definetly recommend friends or family to stay here when in the city."
21233515,Sheila,5,Great location for downtown meetings.
21233515,Graham,5,Great host with a spectacular location. Very accommodating and easy to work with!
21233515,Max,5,"Very nice place clean and great location. Was very easy to get into the place. We even arrived an hour early and where able to check in. 

Very happy over all. Would recommend this place to anyone needing a spot in Toronto for them and a couple of friends"
21233515,Scott,5,Awesome place and location! 5 mins from the downtown airport and a scenic view of the water. Hosts were great and it was super-easy to check in.
21233515,Dain,5,Very clean and well-kept space. Great for weekday commuters. The host was very responsive whenever I had a request.
21327987,Vanessa,5,Great spot. Close to everything we needed. Fit our  family of 4 just fine. The heated spa was a nice warm up to the cloudy/rainy weather we had.
21327987,Michelle,5,Perfect downtown location. Just a 10 minute walk from Union station and close to all kinds of restaurants and things to do. Communication made it easy and seamless process and was convenient to get the keys for the unit. Nice little place that beats staying in a hotel!
21327987,Morris,5,Great location youâ€™re literally in the middle of everything!
21327987,Hitomi,5,The room was clean and located in a very convenient area. We could check in & out without problem. We enjoyed our stay here!
21327987,Nadine,4,Centrally located to everything
21405992,Autumn,5,Great place to stay! I had a lovely time
21405992,Jade,5,"Great small place to stay in at a great value while staying close to the city! We loved that Soni & Suresh provided us some cokes & waters, it was a kind gesture. Would recommend to anyone for this awesome price!"
21405992,Jessika,5,"Suresh and Soniâ€™s place was a great place to stay, sparkling clean, and host did check on me during my stay."
21405992,Ben,5,Comfortable and close to downtown toronto
21405992,Jackie,5,"A very good deal for the money. Easy parking around the corner. Everything was explained ahead of time. Communication was good.  Small bathroom but a large shower stall. Everything was very clean. There is a microwave, small fridge, coffee maker etc.. I was able to make scrambled eggs every morning. They left water & soda in the fridge for us.  This place is small and kind of plain but fine for what you're paying. My husband didn't like that there was no window but we knew that ahead of time. I wish there was somewhere to sit outside and a brighter light at the entrance. Overall we enjoyed our stay. If you want something fancy, go somewhere else but if you want a good deal, this is it."
21462204,Carmesi,5,"Clean, convenient location, great communication! Would highly recommend!"
21462204,Mauricio,5,"Kyleâ€™s place offers people a quiet and warm experience to those visiting whether during the summer or winter. Having stayed at many different airbnbs, I can say you will not have issues keeping the place at the right temperature whether hot or cold. In my opinion, you will have everything you need such as a comfortable bed, good TV and Netflix, a Kitchen to prepare or store any food, and laundry. The place is relatively close to Yorkdale shopping center which I personally enjoy going to with my wife. I recommend this place 100%. Thank you Kyle!"
21462204,Jonathon,5,Kyle's place was clean is in a great location - the street parking was tricky but would overall definitely recommend!
21462204,Darius,5,"This space was great! It had every amenity that we needed. Full kitchen, private space and even a fire place.  Much more than we expected and it looks exactly like photos. We were close to an area with plenty of food and drink options.  The hosts, Kyle and Dee. were very responsive and answered all of our questions very quickly.  

My only heads up would be to plan to duck low if you are as tall as I am (6â€™3 ft.) as the ceilings are low. Also, the bed wasnâ€™t very comfortable but after the first night we were used to it. 

A beautiful home with great hosts, highly recommend staying at this lovely home and definitely plan to stay again!"
21462204,Karen,4,Good for the price.
21579122,Rich,5,Ita is great place was great
21579122,Scott,5,"Great location, great view and clean apartment. Perfect for single or couple."
21579122,Shukhrat,5,"Booked last moment, Tina was very quick to respond with check-in instructions and wi-fi password which was truly highspeed one. Stayed on 57th floor studio with great views of both city and lake. Close to everything I needed (Union Station/E11even restaurant). Any of my questions very answered under 10 mins."
21579122,Sean,4,The location was great and the space was very nice.
21579122,Jennifer,4,Overall a nice place to stay. The TV never worked and this was very frustrating. The host has an Amazon fire stick instead of cable and the previous guest had signed out of the account. The host was unable to fix this during my stay and this could have all been avoided if she had cable or even local tv through an antenna.
21641935,Souleyman,5,Amazing view
21641935,Howard,4,"great value and location. could use some ""sprucing up"".  some small repairs and new coat of paint."
21641935,Dawn,3,"The condo was fine but not worth the $$. What started off at $188 CAD per night ended up with added fees to over $300 per night. Be mindful of your receipt as mine was sent in Euros instead of CAD or US dollars- the cost appeared less than it really was. For that price we would have rather stayed at a hotel in a more central location with fresh linens.  The condo is at LEAST a 25 minute walk to core shopping/ restaurants. The walls are dirty, bathroom cabinets were dirty. And after paying for the room you then get these odd check in instructions sent to you indicating not to talk to the concierge, and if anyone asks tell them you are visiting a friend, etc... We are grown adults who are legitimately paying to stay here. If your condo frowns at Air BNB then you should NOT have one! Guests should not be made to feel like they are sneaking around.  On top of that the main AirBNB customer service is rude and useless.  Jessica didnâ€™t even begin responding to messages until less than 24 hours of our arrival time.  We would definitely NOT stay here again- I would rather spend that kind of money and energy at a hotel."
21641935,Corinne,3,This place is bare bones.  If you need a spacious apartment in downtown Toronto consider it but be forewarned- the apartment is very noisy and bright  there are very few amenities or perks.  We stayed for a business trip (two colleagues) and appreciated the space but did not find it to be a great value.
21683443,Rosio,5,It was a lovely experience.
21683443,Gregory,5,Very nice location. We were able to easily walk to breakfast every morning and then to downtown without a problem.
21683443,McCallum,5,"Ivanaâ€™s place was just as advertised. Perfect location for our week trip to Toronto! Very centrally located, we were able to get around the area on foot/Uber. Great coffee shops and restaurants just around the corner, we sure found ourselves quite at home."
21683443,Loren,5,Awesome location super central to a great street of shopping and eating.
21683443,Brooke,5,"We loved our stay in Ivana's Toronto apartment. It was an incredible location for what we like to do. Close proximity to amazing cafes, shops and restaurants. Its such a pleasant neighborhood to explore. A few minutes walk to the beautiful Trinity Bells Park was an added plus. We will definitely be back to stay in the future and highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a unique Toronto experience."
21702224,Karl,5,Great spot within walking distance to many of the places we wanted to check out including the St. Lawrence Market.
21702224,Allison,5,"Lovely city view. Clean, updated space. Cindy gave detailed instructions for check in. No worries. Perfect area. We felt safe and it is a quiet building. Close to all of our planned activities.  We used Uber to go to a couple of spots during the evening so we could avoid driving in heavy traffic."
21702224,Anna,5,"Cindy was a great host, quick to answer our questions, gave us clear instruction for check-in and parking, information about the neighborhood, tips etc. It was a short stay for us since we had a very tight busy schedule and needed to leave early the next morning, but all of us (3 adults and 2 young kids) was able to sleep and rest well (comfortable bed!), and that's exactly what we needed.  Thank you very much Cindy for hosting us."
21702224,Nicole,4,"Located in a great location. Close to public transportations, Toronto Eaton Centre, grocery stores, St. Lawrence Market, and etc."
21702224,Daniel,4,This place was great! Good location. Very walkable around the area
21736923,Sami,5,"Great location, great space!"
21736923,Sarah,5,"Bright, clean and in a great location."
21736923,Nick,5,Would stay here again!
21736923,Sabrina,5,Great and amazing place! Private and very spacious. Amazing view from balcony. Very homey!
21838013,Cathy,5,"Chung was awesome, great hospitality and accommodated us in every way he could without disrupting his own life :) he went out of his way to make everything smooth. Definitely would stay here again."
21838013,Zalma,5,"Awesome host, beautiful place, very confortable bed!! 5 stars"
21838013,Brenna,5,"Charlie and his place were both great! Cute & clean house, safe area, great location, comfy bed and Charlie himself is great! Very easy going and fun to talk to! I would definitely stay here again and advise others to as well! Thanks Charlie!"
21838013,Ian,5,Charlie was one of the friendliest people I've had the pleasure of meeting. He is incredibly personable and will point you in the right direction if you are unfamiliar with the area. Also I will be looking to get some flannel sheets due to how comfortable the bed was. When I am back in the Toronto area I will be staying here if available.
21838013,Raven,5,"This place is great. Charlie is an excellent host, he was very nice and hospitable, the epitome of what you hope for in an Airbnb host. His house is easy to find, the blue light on the porch is a nice touch to help distinguish it in the night. The rooms are clearly labeled, which I've had troubles in the past figuring out which room is mine, so the labels is very appreciated. He was very communicative, gave me TONS of info on checking in, we even got a lock and key for our room which felt nice.  The bathroom light is a little confusing, the lightswitch is outside the bathroom, it's the second one not closest to the bathroom door, and there is a near microscopic fader switch next to it to dim/brighten it. We had much trouble finding this so word to the wise for the next guest, hahah. The house is a bit worn, there are stains on the carpets and it looks a bit dated, but it makes it feel homey, and the place is definitely CLEAN otherwise.  Charlie greeted us, was super friendly, and even got up at 4 in the freaking morning to set up the breakfast he provided.  The cereal and toast was PERFECT to fill me up for the 5 hours I had to travel back to the states so that was much appreciated as well.  The ability to park in the driveway/on the street is super rare in Toronto and worked perfectly for us.  I would definitely recommend this place and would stay there again!"
21900543,Sadaf,5,It is a great Tiny place and very clean.
21900543,Cat,5,Sammyâ€™s place was awesome! Very clean and cozy. Everything was so close too! Was able to walk everywhere. Had a bit of a problem with the TV/internet but it wasnâ€™t a big deal since we were out most of the day/night! I would definitely stay here again!
21900543,Alexander,4,"Excellent place and location, great building. The only thing not available is a balcony which wouldâ€™ve taken this place over the top. Sammy was great with communication and youâ€™re in the heart of a lot of areas. Enjoyed and would return."
21900543,Bianca,4,"Great location, Sammy was very responsive and helpful. But for the price, we expected more amenities such as coffee and bottled water. If Maybe could have been a little cleaner. If not for that weâ€™d give 5 stars for sure. If youâ€™re just looking for a place to sleep while you explore Toronto this place is ideal."
21900543,Lynda,3,"Robby was very helpful and quick to respond to all of our communications with him. His place is fresh and modern and in a great location, but we found that we wanted to like it more than we did. For us, it had one major problem and several little ones. The big problem was the bed itself: it was extremely hard (not firm) and so uncomfortable that my friend and I were both waking up frequently in the night with aching backs and hip pain, taking ibuprofen to try to help. It felt like we were camping on the ground with just a thin sleeping pad. Not having a good night's sleep made it tough to be excited about seeing the sights in Toronto.

The little inconveniences included no in-suite coffee, we couldn't find hand towels, and we couldn't get anything on the TV. This was our first experience where you get the whole place (as opposed to a suite in someone's house) and it may be typical for this type of rental, but we really missed  these common hotel amenities. The place was top clean, but not super clean. In the bathroom, for example, the sink and toilet bowl were both clean enough, but the baseboards, base of the toilet, outlets - really any other surface - was covered with a pretty good layer of dust.

There were also some inconveniences outside of the host's control that are just good to be aware of. Parking costs about $25 a day and you have to go renew the parking in the morning and at night. Access to parking required going outside the building and down through a horribly disgusting and convoluted stairwell. Also, the fire alarm went off in the middle of the night and we had no idea what it was.  We texted Robby right away and he was great to get back to us quickly. Talking to another tenant the next day, we learned that this is a frequent occurrence, so future guests might just want to know of the possibility."
21984758,Ty J.,5,"great location, clean,"
21984758,Jake,5,Great location! Love the place.
21984758,Todd,5,"Great space, perfect for our family of four to visit Toronto. Within walking distance of the entertainment district and other Toronto must sees. Beds were comfortable, view was beautiful and it was super clean."
21984758,Stephanie,4,"The condo was just as pictured. Within walking distance to entertainment and restaurants. If you follow the check in instructions, everything will run smoothly."
21984758,Joe,3,It was no really good experience no internet service the tv I canâ€™t turn on I call several time to the host never answer so unfortunately no good experience are all
22001921,Michael,5,"Excellent location, great view and a good building.  If you want a place in the center of things, this is a great choice.  I'll be coming back!"
22001921,Edgar,5,"Jay and Billyâ€™s stylish unit was just as spectacular as it looks in the pictures. The views of the CN Tower and skyline are breathtaking. The proximity to all the downtown attractions was ideal for walking and made my stay very easy and effortless. Overall the unit is beautiful, cozy and well laid out. Canâ€™t wait to stay here again!"
22001921,Karen,5,The apartment is clean and crisp. Feels like a hotel as opposed to a home. The floor-to-ceiling windows provide amazing views and we loved that we could open the window (with a screen and high safety railing) for some fresh air even while so many flights up. The location is about a 25 minute walk to many attractions - can walk or take a quick cab ride. Would stay again and recommend it to others.
22001921,Tchad,5,"You get what you pay for, which in this case is a good thing. The spot looks exactly as it is in pictures, clean and spartan. Everything you need, restaurants and stores, are close by, and you're also within equidistant walking distance from the lake, the art district, and downtown.  However, the greatest feature is obviously the view of the skyline and lake - which again appears exactly as it appears in the space's pictures. I'd recommend a stay here."
22001921,Daniel,4,Excellent response. Great communication and the place has a wonderful view
22081247,TandE,5,Great place and location!
22081247,Valerie,5,Very nice space. Close to CN Tower with amazing view.
22081247,Nick,5,Great location and amazing views. Perfect launching pad for enjoying the city!
22081247,Lauren,5,We were in town for the marathon. Was a perfect home base for comfort and location. Exactly as pictured and very clean. We loved our stay and highly recommend this apartment. Thank you Andreanne and Carole!
22081247,Kathryn,5,"Great location, close to everything. Easy key pick up and drop off. The hosts were fast with responding to our questions which is always nice!  Overall, a lovely place to stay!"
22083516,Shishir,5,The place is at a great location. Minutes walk to everything.  Very comfortable.
22083516,Jonathan,5,The place was clean and near a lot of the major tourist attractions youâ€™d want to visit while in Toronto!
22083516,Francesca,5,This place was amazing! Very clean & great walking distance to everything. Alper was so helpful too & answered any question you had super quick. Definitely recommend
22083516,Daniel,5,Alper was a great host. I'll be back!
22083516,Jesse,5,"Just as pictured, stylish and super clean!"
22100548,Robert,5,"Clean, great location, excellent host. Would definitely stay again"
22100548,Jaclyn,5,Easy to get in touch with host for any needs.
22100548,London,4,"Perfect for a couple or two friends who love to explore on their feet. The subways were down when I visited so we walked everywhere, which felt great! However, I do wish there was parking on site."
22100548,Beth Ann,4,"Nice place, clean, modern, reasonably priced. Located right in downtown area. Vinny was helpful with sending us a map with overnight parking for our car. Would definately reccomend. Only complaint was the apartment was a bit cold, although the space heater warmed it up for us to sleep comfortably at night. Overall good experience."
22100548,Rebecca,3,"Great location, but we had a little trouble finding the place after walking from our parking spot. Maybe I didnâ€™t catch a heads up to look at the map?

Be prepared to pay for offsite parking a few blocks away. Torontoâ€™s parking app is pretty easy to navigate. 

My friend slept on the pullout and the mattress was very thin and we couldnâ€™t get it back together. Lastly, nearly a third of the vertical blinds were missing and stuffed in the closet. We had to wake up in total full daylight."
22292859,Grace,5,Perfect location
22292859,Janior,5,Great location in Downtown Toronto. Host was very available for any questions we had and tons of nearby places to eat. Everything was a short walking distance from the place which was great!
22292859,Anna,5,"Experience was amazing, would highly recommend and would stay here again if back in town."
22292859,Dan,5,"We had a great time at Steveâ€™s place. He was very thorough and timely with his communications. The place was in a prime location, convenient to Union Station and many of the cities highlights. Check-in/out processes were easy and having a parking space was convenient as we rented a car for a day to go to Niagara. Would definitely recommend and stay again in the future."
22292859,Tanja,4,"The apartment is lovely and comfortable as well as in a great location. The check in process could be improved, but otherwise a great experience"
22665638,Meaghan,5,"It was a beautiful experience. The location was awesome, and the suite was wonderful. We felt very comfortable. The plumbing was a bit sensitive, but the hosts helped us out with the issue."
22665638,Bianca,5,"Clean, fancy looking space in a great location! Great communication with the hosts."
22665638,Christopher,5,"Had a great time, very clean and well hosted. Slightly loud hearing footsteps from upstairs as noted, but nothing too disruptive"
22665638,Brittney,5,"We had a short stay here but it was great! Checking in and out was easy and the place had everything we needed, also it was conveniently close to a bus stop that got us where we needed to go."
22665638,Matthew,5,"Great area, quiet and close to everything"
22676052,Kevin,5,Great location and easy check-in and check-out.
22676052,Tamiko,5,"This was my second stay in the apartment. I love this location on Bay, near the Y and the restaurants and stores on Yonge and Church. However, it's a great quiet location.

I enjoyed staying here and the parking is convenient since I drive in. Also, the check-in is easy (even with a car, I was able to park by the 7-11 for the two minutes it took to get the keys) and I was then able to get right into the garage.

Another great stay in a clean, well equipped apartment! Thank you."
22676052,Wangshu,5,"5 star rating,definitely recommend"
22676052,Katie,5,"Nice modern space with a great view, quite centrally located and easy to walk to everything.  Picking up the key a few blocks away was a bit of an added step, but worked smoothly and had no issues.  The hosts were quick to respond to my messages and answer any questions, I appreciated them working with me to keep my luggage there until my flight left later.  Thanks!"
22676052,David,5,"I walked into the apartment to a stunning sunset over the city.  Superclean.  The place looked as advertised.  Key pickup was a couple blocks away, but easy.  Communication with host was outstanding.  Parking was several stories underground in a dedicated parking spot.  I did not need my car while in Toronto.  Convenient to public transportation, just a couple blocks from the subway.  Perfect place to be based while at a conference at University of Toronto."
22900152,Kevin,5,Location was great for where we were going. We went to Rebel Nightclub for a concert and it was 12 minutes away so that was convenient for us. Check in and check out was easy. The apartment had a loft bed which was cool. Good place to stay.
22900152,Michael,5,"Sandra was a great host. Her place was clean, conveniently located, and she provided all the necessary amenities (as well as local tips). Iâ€™d happily stay at her place again, given the opportunity!"
22900152,Elizabeth,5,Nice space in a cozy neighborhood.  The host communicated promptly and left thoughtful touches (i.e. a variety of toiletries).
22900152,Ashley,5,"Great location, we Uberâ€™d around and it was quick and convenient. Love the loft bed, very comfortable & the shower had great water pressure. Only issue we had was the narrow staircase, but that was minor."
22900152,Milagros,5,"Neat, clean, quiet neighborhood, good free parking area - host very accommodating. Will be back."
23019003,Emma,5,Loved my stay here. Beautiful place!!
23019003,Kaira,5,I loved staying here! Best check in experience and free parking in a super great location! Oz was wonderful at communicating and the space was awesome! I will definitely stay again!
23019003,Julie,5,Oz was super informative and was a great host. His place was very clean and location was perfect for us
23019003,Mary,5,"The hosts were attentive, friendly, and very easy to reach. Their check-in and check-out procedures were very detailed which made it easier for us. The townhome is beautifully decorated. There are minor signs of wear, but didnâ€™t affect our stay much. We still had a very comfortable stay. For such a cozy size of a home, the furniture and decor was planned very efficiently so it didnâ€™t feel stuffy. 
Traveling as a family with a stroller though, itâ€™s important to note there are steps leading down to the entrance of the townhome as well and step to the parking garage. So just mind the steps. 
We loved the location because it was close to highways and major attractions. Because there were many rainy days during our stay, we were extremely grateful to have a garage for our car and for the garage to be close to the townhome."
23019003,Belgica,5,"My family and I enjoyed the comfort and cleanliness of this unit and how neatly arranged everything is. Alper was a thoughtful and welcoming host and was available to communicate at every stage of our visit, from prior to arrival to our departure. The location is excellent in terms of being able to walk to different areas and is also peaceful for a good nightâ€™s rest. We felt safe and cared for here and would gladly return."
23110484,Adriel,5,Great location. Affordable parking right across the street 10min or less to everything . Really good value. Jay  was also very down to earth. Would stay in his place when in Toronto for sure
23110484,Julian,5,For my first visit to Toronto this was the best place to stay and Iâ€™d definitely stay there again.
23110484,Herberth,5,Place is very clean and very nice. A walk away from restaurants and bars. Will definitely book again.
23110484,Barbara,5,Very clean. Apartment was fully stocked with everything needed. Convenient location it was within walking distance to everything. I highly recommend when visiting Toronto.
23110484,Ethan,5,"If you're looking for a place to stay in Toronto, and this place is available, get it.  It's clean, it's well stocked, and it's right in the heart of where you want to be.  It's a 5-minute walk to the CN Tower and Rogers Stadium.  You won't be sorry about staying here."
23168522,Thuly,5,A lovely and quiet place to stay in Toronto. The offered parking space is greatly appreciated and the location is perfect. Super close to all the places that we were planning on visiting and is definitely a great place for two people. I love all the extra pillows and tiny touches around the place and the check in process was the most easiest! Totally recommended and we would stay here again if weâ€™re back in Toronto.
23168522,Sydney,5,"John's place was very clean and in a great location, especially if you plan to use the subway. The space was great for what we were looking for, which was a simple place to sleep. John also provided great communication and even let us check in a bit earlier than usual. Would definitely recommend to anyone planning to travel to Toronto and looking for a reasonably priced place to stay."
23168522,Yutong,5,"Johnâ€™s place is located right next to Dupont station, which is less than 15 min metro ride to downtown area. The apartment is in the back of a building. It is small but cozy. The amenities are complete"
23168522,John,4,"Nice place, location is good to get to downtown, apartment is clean enough. Pretty much as advertised."
23168522,Maria,4,"We stayed 3 nights and only were in the apt. for sleeping so it worked well for us. It is small but the location is good with a subway stop one block away. We did not use the kitchenette at all but it is available if needed. Several places nearby for breakfast coffee and lunch or dinner. The off street parking place was great as we did not want to use our car in the city. it is a good value in an expensive city. Thank you, John!"
23189004,Brandon,5,Great Views.
23189004,Peggy,5,"Great place, perfect location"
23189004,Shelby,5,"So very close and walkable to everything in the city, and gorgeous lake views"
23189004,Cheryl,5,"If you want to be in downtown Toronto, this is the place to stay. We rented a car because we needed to go to Niagara Falls for the day for a conference, but other than that, we had no reason to move the car. We walked everywhere, enjoyed visiting numerous restaurants and bars, and loved being able to come back and relax in this condo on the 56th floor overlooking Lake Ontario. Highly recommend!!"
23189004,Miriam,4,"modern ,small space with fantastic views"
23277931,Miguel,5,The place was clean and spacious. Sofia was very nice to us and the family let us use their washer and dryer at any time during the weekend which was really nice!
23277931,Gray,5,A wonderful and affordable Airbnb. It was perfect for my short stay and easy to check in and out. Made my trip much more stress free
23277931,Phuong,5,"Sofia responds to the messages very quickly so I always get the feeling of being welcomed. Although the place is quite far from downtown, it is only 15' away from the airport so that's a huge plus for tourists like me since traffic in Toronto is a huge pain.  Nice, welcoming host overall. Recommend."
23277931,Azita,4,Sofiaâ€™s place was good for our one night stay. Not too many frills and just right for the value! Comfortable night sleep! :-)
23277931,Mason,4,Sofia was so kind and helpful. The bed is really big and comfortable and the room stays nice and warm!
23330000,Leia,5,It was a good place to stay and at a great price. Sofia is very kind and made sure to do anything to make our stay more comfortable.
23330000,Cristina,5,Great price and easy check in. Hosts are friendly and accommodating.
23330000,Juliet,5,Very kind host! Perfect distance to the airport.
23330000,Christopher,5,"Very nice, safe, well organized and communicative host. I look forward to staying with Sofia again."
23330000,Peter,5,"I'm very thankful for your support in our stay, I hope to be lucky by being hosted again by Sofia. It felt like being home while hosted on Sofia's place, she is very helpful and caring, the place is near everything, you can move easily to Toronto's Downtown and the area is very quiet. Would love being hosted again with her, many thanks!"
23339884,Madison,5,The place was beautiful and Jessica was a great host !
23339884,John,5,Check-in could not have been easier! The place was SUPER clean. Loved the location. Loved the amount of natural light!! Loved going out on to the balcony every night. The bed was extremely comfortable! Had such a wonderful two weeks there.
23339884,Lawrence,5,Perfect for our stay in Toronto! Thanks!
23339884,Noemi,5,The apartment was such a great space and with awesome views. Wonderful location. We had a great stay!
23339884,Marsena,5,"Everything about this place is amazing! Location is ideal if youâ€™re wanting to enjoy the city night life, shop, and dine. I didnâ€™t get a chance to meet Jessica but she was available whenever I reached out to her. The check in process was smooth, and there wasnâ€™t a lot of noise besides the construction in the morning. But itâ€™s good to wake up early to enjoy everything that Toronto has to offer! I want to come back for the summer! I love Toronto and Iâ€™ll definitely be staying here again! â¤ï¸"
23342739,Mark,5,Great host. Amazing place for a very affordable price.
23342739,Redmond,5,Was a great host easy check in and no problems.
23342739,Rey,5,"Such a comfy place , we enjoyed staying there."
23342739,Leo,5,"Very clean and nice space, the host is very nice. Please be mindful they have a little kid so be very quite in the evening"
23342739,Shelanise,2,"If you are OCD and have high standards, I would never stay here again even for a quick nap. Not going to get into specifics, but basically the pics had to have been taken at least 10 years ago."
23439208,Gregory,5,What a view!!! Great place to take in TO!
23439208,Marck,5,Jay is a great host! Definitely would book with him again.
23439208,Edna,5,Outstanding! We had the best time in Toronto thanks to Jayâ€™s place.We walked everywhere. The apartment has everything you need. The view is just stunning. Will definitely stay here again... Very recommended...
23439208,Amy,5,"Beautiful view, very convenient to public transportation, walking distance (about a mile) to CN Tower and Chinatown (which was much smaller than I remember it being 40 years ago) and Kensington market. Parking (extra $20 a night) was a plus too."
23439208,Sarah,3,"The location and view is fantastic, my boyfriend and I were both happy with that. The unit itself is fairly empty; it doesn't feel welcoming or homey at all. A rug and something hanging on the walls wouldn't hurt, really just any basic decor. There was also no bottom to the nightstand drawer and the shower curtain was a little past it's date in terms of cleanliness. We stayed here for two nights in October after the heat was just turned on in the builidng. Even after turning the heat off in the unit and keeping the livingroom window open (the bedroom window did not open) we were unable to bring the temperature of the unit below 25.5 even though it was around 14 outside. We ended up sleeping in the living room the second night where we could at least feel the breeze. Again, the view and location is top notch. The hosts are responsive and the on site parking (for an additional fee) is convenient."
23752030,Caleb,5,Great place. Convenient location. Great host.
23752030,Devin,5,"Everything was perfect, but be warned, this place is not for tall people. If youâ€™re under 6 foot this place will work beautifully. 

Other than height, the stat was exceptional."
23752030,Hanna,5,Sweet place! Great for a quick trip :)
23752030,Rebecca,5,"My bf and I stayed here for the night and is was absolutely great! Granted the space isnâ€™t meant for people who are 6â€™7  (my bf), it was super comfy and homey and we definitely appreciated how easy communication was. Oh and itâ€™s super close to a lot of nearby restaurants and shops, it was perfect. Thanks for everything Michael and Carole! (:"
23752030,Luis,5,"This place is perfectly located, clean and with all the essential for your stay. My wife and I used mostly for sleeping and resting between our exploration around Toronto. It is close to very nice restaurants and shops and with easy access to public transportation and a 10 min ride to the Billy Bishop Airport. It is small if you are very tall, but for us it was not a problem at all."
23981621,Adam,5,Dale is a nice host and this spot is in the perfect location for everything that you would need our want to do in Toronto.
23981621,Daniel,5,"Great place with a nice view in a convenient location. Dale was very prompt with any questions I had. Overall, easy pleasant stay in Toronto!"
23981621,Troy,5,"Dale is a great host and the apartment comes exactly as advertised. Dale gives very detailed and helpful instructions for checking in to the apartment. He was also helpful in providing tips for parking. The apartment itself is clean, spacious, and incredibly convenient from a location standpoint. Would definitely stay here again when returning to Toronto."
23981621,Josiah,5,"This place was fantastic! It was spacious, clean, and comfortable. The best part of it was the view, location, and price! It was right in the heart of Toronto. I would highly recommend this place for everybody!"
23981621,Kevin,5,"Great location, kind of shocking instructions to find but everything worked out find. Will for sure use again."
24021226,Matthew,5,"Jay's place is spacious, warm, cozy, in a great location and easy to check-in/check-out. There is a full kitchen, a balcony, big soaking tub, access to streaming services, great wi-fi, and plenty of mirrors. We didn't really use the building amenities, but they were easy to access and the gym was really well-equipped."
24021226,Kathy,5,"Jay's apartment could not be in a more perfect location! We parked our car in the secure underground parking lot and never took it out during our stay because we could walk everywhere! The unit was a perfect size for the 2 of us and though we didn't use the kitchen, it was well-stocked with everything one would need. The building is safe and staffed with full time security as is the underground parking. Follow Jay's instructions to the letter on his check in process and you will have no problems at all! He makes it very clear in his step by step directions. We would definitely like to stay at Jay's again if we are lucky enough to visit Toronto again!"
24021226,Dave,5,"Very walk-able area. One direction leads straight to the harbor front, the other leads straight towards tons of entertainment, bars, food etc. Very close to public trans in any direction."
24021226,Danielle,5,This is the most beautiful Airbnb Iâ€™ve ever stayed in. Great location with fabulous views and very clean. Super comfy bed. Looking forward to my next trip to Toronto so I can book this apt again! Highly recommend.
24021226,Joser,4,Jayâ€™s place was amazing! Great location in the heat of Toronto! Communication was on point! We will definitely be back!

24058995,Sierra,5,"Todd's apartment was in such a great spot in the city and exactly what we needed. Only minutes from Casa Loma which we recommend while visiting. Great apartment, highly recommend!"
24058995,Seil,5,Located in a quiet residential area but really close to U of T. The room I stayed in was clean and quiet. The bed was also super comfortable. Highly recommend for short stays.
24411312,Cody,5,What a great stay! The place was so easy to access and was ready and sparkling clean. It had everything we needed and was very nicely decorated. Very welcoming! 10/10 Would recommend to anyone in the area.
24411312,Brittany,5,Frankâ€™s basement apartment is just as described. Tiny and cozy and in a great location! We had a lovely stay for a short visit in Toronto. Convenient check-in directions too. Would stay again on a future visit.
24411312,Dimitri,5,Amazing. Would definitely return. Thank you!
24411312,Maceo,5,"Easy to get to airports. Simple, easy place with responsive host."
24411312,Cameron,5,"Tidy basement close to the metro stop. Overall met my expectations. I'm 6'2"" and survived a single night no problem. We did come home to a skunk greeting us by the back door - then we ran. But all around fine stay."
24422618,Liam,5,Stylish and great location
24422618,Hannah,5,We had a wonderful stay! The location was awesome for doing stuff right in town. The place was super clean and a really comfortable home away from home! Would definitely recommend it!
24422618,Saba,5,This place was stunning! The building was modern and located in one of the swankiest neighborhoods in Toronto. I would expect a comparable hotel room in the same location to be four or five times the price of this place. Highly recommended.
24422618,Chris,5,"Great space,  centrally located and near subway entrance."
24422618,Martin,4,put shelves in closet for clothing.
24524343,Brian,5,Jessica is a great host and the place is very nice. Amazing views and great location
24524343,Catherine,5,"We went to a Leafs game and this was the perfect location just steps from Scotiabank Arena! Beautiful view of the city and CN tower, definitely an added bonus!"
24524343,Kevin,5,Absolutely Amazing Location! Walking Distance To Several Locations! Stunning Views! The Place Was As Described If Not Better. Highly Recommend This Place To Anyone!
24524343,Warren,5,Jessica's apartment is very well located and convenient to everything.   The fitness center and pool are convenient and easy to use. There  is ample parking in the neighborhood.  The building is nice and quiet and the views from the apartment are great.
24524343,Joel,4,Dope place not as big as pictures though had a great stay !
24894787,Nicholas,5,Very clean and comfy! Location was very ideal too!
24894787,Aaron,5,Place is exactly like it promotes and great that is was right downtown.
24894787,Christine,5,"A clean, comfortable, and stylish place with an unbeatable location."
24894787,Edee,1,"My boyfriend and I stayed at this Airbnb location form August 2-4, and our entire experience was horrendous. For starters, locating the address was so stressful, the physical address is quite different from what was listed, and on a busy street like Yorkville, traffic is despicable. 

Arriving at the Airbnb location, we werenâ€™t able to park in the garage in the building although we had already prepaid for parking through the host. A refund took over 10 days to process. Basic amenities like towels and body wash wasnâ€™t present in the apartment on our arrival. Overall, this apartment was really small, it has no scenic view and isnâ€™t worth the price of the stay."
25208606,Courtney,5,Perfect location! The space was great for one person.
25208606,Bethany,5,"Todd's place was very conveniently located just a few blocks from the subway station. It was close to downtown and easy to get around on public transportation. The space is quite small, with the bed taking up most of the floor space, but was comfortable and had everything we needed. We liked that there was a lock box so that we could check in and out on our own schedule. The hosts quickly responded to questions and were well organized. We would definitely stay here again!"
25208606,Justin,5,"This is an outstanding location, just a short walk from some of Torontoâ€™s best restaurants and cafes, and an easy commute to pretty much anywhere else in the city by metro.  Communication is great, and instructions for self check-in are perfect. The unit is on the small side, but has a high ceiling, so itâ€™s cozy without being claustrophobic. I think itâ€™s ideal for short stays, and wouldnâ€™t hesitate to visit again."
25208606,Sophia,4,Good place to stay for a weekend or night in Toronto! Todd is helpful and responsive (-:
25208606,Julie,4,Todd's place is well situated and provides the basics for anyone in town for a short period of time.
25211815,Shelia,5,Great location. Comfy.
25211815,Carlos,5,Amazing place
25211815,Benyamin,5,Clean room close to downtown.
25211815,Salman,5,"Gaurav was an excellent host. He was easy to reach out and was very accurate about the descriptions of the place and its surroundings. It took me sometime to figure out the street parking, but Gaurav assisted me late in the night to find the parking and the place. The apartment is not lavish, but for the price, thereâ€™s nothing comparable if You are looking to stay in the downtown. Most of all Gurav turned out to be a thorough gentleman, very humble and accommodating. I would still chose this place for a business trip or just traveling to Toronto. 
Thank you Gaurav."
25211815,Edward,5,Gaurav's place was clean and close to downtown and transit. Guarav was a friendly a easy to work with host!
25475941,Ben,5,"Perfect flat for a business trip. Great location, clean, nice amenities, and easy check in. Would  stay there again."

The location was great. Very clean and modern."
25475941,Chandler,5,"Fantastic place, located centrally in Toronto"
25475941,Heaven-Lee,5,"Beautiful space, exactly what you need for this trip!!

The place is exceptionally clean and in a safe neighborhood. Most importantly, you are near all of the major streets for attractions. There is never a dull moment as you are close to entertainment, transportation, and shops.

Perfect space if you are from out of town and looking for a place to stay."
25579263,Waheed,5,Great place. Convenient. Spotless. Will stay again.
25579263,Yifan,5,It was a great experience here! The apartment is very clean and the location was great. I would recommend it to anyone who visits Toronto.
25579263,Michael,5,Great condo for a 3 night stay. Easy to walk to most things we wanted to see.
25579263,Brian,5,Great location in Toronto! We were able to walk to many shops and restaurants and only a short drive downtown and to the Harbour. Hosts were easily accessible and responded EXTREMELY timely. Great spot for couples & quick & easy check-in :)
25579263,Erin,4,"Parking not included, was very expensive. Would have been good to know up front."
25771793,Patrick,5,"Overall very happy with the apartment, great location to walk anywhere"
25771793,Robert,5,"Very nice apartment, fantastic location. Apartment has a ton of key only access points for safety. Great place!"
25771793,Chetan,5,Great spot near the city.
25771793,Rachel,4,Great space.
25771793,Kenneth,3,"This apartment was in a great location, within walking distance from the conference we were attending. There was also a grocery store, liquor store, coffee shops, and restaurants nearby. They generously provided cooking amenities (cooking oil, cookware, salt and pepper). Had a Netflix account but no cable. Checking in was the only problem we encountered and it was an immensely stressful experience. We stay at Airbnbs often and this was out of the ordinary....I was emailed a link which told me the keys to the apartment were in a ""keycafe"" lock box at a pizza shop around the corner. I was told there would be free parking, however upon arrival there was no place to park and no directions as where to park, therefore reaching the ""keycafe"" lock box was not feasible. Upon calling the host to clarify, they informed me that the key was inside the unlocked apartment and that I needed to park in a ""guest spot"" (which were full) to go up to get the key. They informed me that the free parking spot was in the parking garage but I needed the key to access it. So, the only option was to leave my car in front of a ""no parking"" sign with one member of my party in the car. Upon entering the lobby, the security desk would not let me enter the apartment due to the fact that I had no key. I explained that I was staying at an AirBnb in the apartment complex, however they requested to speak with the host as they were unaware and unhappy with the situation. They reluctantly let me in but it was clear that they were upset that the host didn't inform them. I had to call to clarify the room number, key location, and parking spot number as this information was not provided."
25771900,Laura,5,"My friends and I had a great stay here, it was clean and had all that we needed for the night. Itâ€™s also located in a great location in Yorkville."
25771900,Csaba,5,"Great place, close to the metro and museums, and there are plenty restaurant, cafes, etc around! Nice view of the city, comfortable place to sit and relax after a day out and about."
25771900,Christine,5,Beautiful space in a really nice neighborhood
25771900,Jennifer-Hoa,5,"Probably one of the cleanest airbnbâ€™s I have ever stayed at. Itâ€™s super cozy and the perfect location for a weekend getaway with your honey. Itâ€™s located right there from the shopping district and a really close drive to everything else in toronto! Parking ramp was a 1 min walk from the loft itself. The only thing that was a little confusing was how to get to the front desk to check in, but the host picked up the phone really quick to address any needs! 10/10 would recommend."
25771900,Hideko,4,"Very Stylish space to enjoy your single time in Toronto, Great Location, Lots of Restaurants and Shops, Safe Neighborhood,  , Whole Foods is just 5 min walk across the street which is the big YES to me!"
26102101,Jason,5,Comfy place and great location! Judy was a great host and very helpful with recommendations for our stay. We would definitely stay at her place again!
26102101,Albert,5,Very cozy place! I would recommend this to anyone. Very close to good restaurants and public transportation to get you in and around the city. Iâ€™m definitely staying here again when I visit the area again :)
26102101,Steven,5,Judyâ€™s place was a great place to stay in a beautiful neighborhood. Many shops and restaurants were within walking distance. Judy was very welcoming and friendly during our entire stay! My wife and I would love staying here again.
26102101,Rebecca,5,"My stay at Judy's place was fantastic. From a warm welcome, friendly (but understanding of jetlag) hosts, fantastic recommendations in a helpful binder to a well located and decorated  space with thoughtful touches. They really went above and beyond, helping with various travelling mishaps with good grace and infinite kindness. Whilst being given my own space, and actually being out of the house working for the majority of my trip, I left feeling recharged with the knowledge there's a friendly hello in Toronto should I need it. I will definitely be back, and wholly recommend you stay here!"
26102101,Sam,5,"Judyâ€™s house is amazing! Highly recommend to stay here. Itâ€™s in a perfect location if you want to stay a little bit outside of the city but still have the city feel. Felt very safe in this neighborhood. Itâ€™s surrounded by great restaurants and a 5 minute walk from the subway. The place is very clean and well decorated. Judy has an amazing garden in her backyard, very nice place to enjoy your coffee/breakfast. Definitely would stay here again when I visit Toronto!"
26127663,Reginald,5,"Immaculate condo everything that you will need is there. location is superb, communication was awesome, can't wait to return!!"

26136453,Qixuan,5,very nice
26136453,Nikki,5,"Great apartment. It was perfect for our short stay in Toronto, allowing us a great view from the 19th floor windows. It was clean and the communication with the hosts was straightforward and professional. Would recommend!"
26136453,Alexandria,5,Edwin was extremely accommodating. We arrived earlier than check in time so he allowed us to park so could tour downtown.  His place was super clean and stylish.  The view of the lake and the city is beautiful! We highly recommend staying here. Amenities of a hotel without the cost.
26263852,Dominic,5,Loved the location. Great views. Solid communicator.
26263852,Mohit,5,Itâ€™s a good place to stay! Good view!
26263852,Lukas,5,Amanda was quick to answer all questions we had and made the stay great!
26263852,Kayla,5,"This is a really nice spot for a stay at Toronto. It's conveniently close to everything in the city. The whole process was really smooth; the hosts did a good job on their part, very clear with instructions. Overall, I enjoyed my experience."
26263852,Hillary,5,Amanda's place was exactly what we were looking for.  The location is fantastic and within walking distance of Rogers Center and lots of bars and restaurants.  She was very quick to respond every time we asked a question during booking as well as during our stay.
26333557,Michael,5,"Exceptional location, great for a solo traveler. Hard to find this kindâ€™ve value in the heart of Toronto. Ben was very responsive and accommodating."
26333557,Owen,5,"Small clean space with a great location for getting out to see the rest of the city, just a short walk to all sports of public transit.  Comfortable bed, slightly noisy but effective AC.  Would stay at again."
26333557,Mary,5,"Cozy, clean and an absolutely amazing location in historic Old Toronto! Ben is a top-notch host: he gave us great tips on places to eat, communicated regularly, and very graciously provided us with muffins and croissants for for our morning, enabling us to get to our appointment. I would stay there again in a heartbeat and hope Iâ€™ll have the opportunity to do so."
26333557,Tiffany,4,"It's an apartment with simple furnishings.  The cleanliness definitely exceeded my expectations.  It's  clear that Ben works hard to make the accommodations clean for every traveler.  The apartment is located in a building with several other apartments, which does mean that you as the person staying there are subject to the noise of those tenants."
26333557,Sophie,3,"We originally had a 5 night reservation here but it was cut short to one night (we arrived at 11 pm to discover the place smelled unbearably of paint fumes as if we were sniffing white out). The host hmessaged us at 6 pm the day we checked in to say he painted the entire studio the day before without leaving the windows open to air out. It was stressful arguing with the host to get a refund (he only offered a partial refund) so we had to contact airbnb to get our full refund and find a new place to stay.

Other cons in addition to the paint fumes: one roll of toilet paper (for what was suppose to be a 5 night stay), old bath towels and visibly slanting floors. It was also really loud with construction sounds of a condo and streetcars passing by. 

Pros: The location is central, a 10 min walk from Yonge & Dundas and the place is cheap (but just because itâ€™s cheap doesnâ€™t mean guests should be expected to sleep with paint fumes)."
26337203,Geoff,5,"Great apartment exactly as described. Communication was prompt and precise, location is central and walkable. Highly recommend for business travelers."
26337203,Addinekia,5,"Peter's place is a great place to spend your vacation stay. Peter's place was so nice and clean.  All the amenities and attractions was close by. When my Husband and I come back, this will be our future vacation spot."
26337203,Katelyn,4,"Great location thatâ€™s close to everything! This was my 2nd time staying here and I was a bit disappointed with the cleanliness this time, but nothing we couldnâ€™t work with. Overall it was still a wonderful stay. Check in and out are so easy, parking isnâ€™t far, and itâ€™s a cozy space. If youâ€™re traveling to Toronto I would recommend it! He offers coupons for Uber and Uber eats, which is a nice touch!"
26337203,Travis,4,Great location and easy to get around Toronto.  Good value!
26337203,Celia,4,It was an awesome location and Peter responded as quick as he could when we needed him to. It had great restaurants around and was easy check in and check out!!
26601705,Filipe,5,"Spencerâ€™s place is very well located, clean and good if youâ€™re in town for a few days and want to enjoy the more cosmopolitan aspects of Toronto. The apartment is in the 2nd floor and there are two flights of stairs that can be challenging if youâ€™re taking heavy luggage. Other than that, the apartment is as described. You wouldnâ€™t regret staying here."
26601705,Erica,5,Great location. Spencerâ€™s place was easy to access and very private. Would recommend!
26601705,Morgan,5,The place was clean when we arrived with more ammenities than expected. It's in a really cool area of Toronto with lots to do right out of the doorstep. We enjoyed our stay here very much.
26601705,Abby,5,"This location is absolutely perfect to get to see all of Toronto! Youâ€™re close to plenty of shops and restaurants/cafes. Public transportation and paid parking are also less than a ten minute walk away. Inside is very clean and roomy, with a nice balcony too. Spencer gave detailed instructions on how to get in/out of the suite and was available for any sort of questions we had. I would definitely recommend traveling pairs to stay here!"
26601705,Julie,4,"Our stay was good, it was a quiet and safe space. The location was the best part. Street parking was difficult to find so we ended up parking in a costly deck quite a few blocks away. The amenities were bare minimum and we were missing several items such as hand soap, a trash can outside of the bathroom, and enough sheets and towels for our three quests. It did not feel clean but it was acceptable. The balcony view isnâ€™t great, and thereâ€™s a fan of some sort right outside of it that makes it unusable from the noise. If youâ€™re not planning on spending much time in the apartment, it would be a good place to stay."
26602305,Danielle,5,This is a super nice apartment! Very clean and has an ideal location. It is right in the middle of downtown and very close to great stores and food places. Great communication with the host and very safe feeling area.
26602305,Castel,5,This apartment was located in a cool area of Toronto. It was clean and Spencer was very easy to communicate with prior to arrival. Would definitely stay here again.
26602305,Sarah,5,"This was our first trip to Toronto, so we were really grateful for Spencer's fast replies to our inquiries. He offered a great suggestion for parking (overnight paid lot behind the KFC), which was close enough that we could easily walk with our luggage to the apartment entrance without getting too wet (it was raining). We felt grateful for the parking suggestion, because just as we arrived, a fleet of 6 or 7 tow trucks was towing the entire street of cars. The check-in directions were really clear, and we felt very safe, especially with the new lock. Although the sounds of the street were fairly audible, we didn't mind that much. Some loud music was playing in the street below, but it ended at a reasonable hour, and after that we slept through the rest. The location is great, great, great! Queen Street is a lovely stroll, with lots of interesting shops and eateries everywhere.  Spadina Ave is a straight shot down to the CN Tower and the waterfront, and the distance is easily walkable. In the other direction is Chinatown, which again has lovely shops and so many options for food and beverages. For breakfast, I enjoyed a fantastic cup of coffee and one of the best muffins I've ever had at The Alternative coffee shop, which is a 4-5 min walk from the apartment, right behind Graffiti Ave. Overall, I'd highly recommend this location for a short stay in Toronto. Clean, safe, well-located, great host, great price."
26602305,Harry,4,Nice and cheap
26602305,Donald,3,"The space is not as new as advertised/lead to believe.  The bathroom smelled of sewage and the shower was full of mold/mildew.  The host was slow to respond, not very warm in his initial responses (prior to arriving) and in his words ""too busy running other properties to personally tend to each unit"".    Once we reported the issue with the bathroom, he was apologetic and offered a minimal refund in exchange for a good review.

This is a great, walk-able location, but I would not stay here again."
26656133,Tom,5,Great Place.  Alper was very availabel to answer any questions
26656133,Marysa,5,Alperâ€™s place is amazing. It was very clean and the view was nice.
26656133,Isabella,5,"Amazing views of the city, awesome location if youâ€™re going to (Email hidden by Airbnb) fy & stylish space. Free parking a definite plus"
26656133,Zakaria,5,"Location: Excellent location for the value, if you include the free parking! The location is really easy to get to and accessible by car and public transit. Uber and Lyft arrives within 1 min at the location. The grocery store and Starbucks are within 30 seconds of the front door (talk about convenience)! The place itself was very well lit. Brunch and Dinner options are all within 5 to 10 min walking distance. Queen Street shopping, Scotiabank Theatre and Rogers Centre are just a few short minutes away. Very convenient!

Place: The unit is high enough so that the nearby construction is not heard. It is quite a spacious space. The bedroom bed and sofa bed in the living room are both comfortable. The floor is really quiet and it is a corner unit. 

Great place. It is already added to one of my favourites next time I am in Toronto!"
26656133,Laura,5,This condo was an amazing stay for the price. The views are spectacular and the location is central to anything You might want to do in Toronto. We hope to stay there again in the future.
26686783,Brittany,5,"Great space, really quiet, great view."
26686783,Julia,5,"Wonderful place to stay! My friend and I stayed here for Caribana weekend and it was walking distance to everything! The kitchen is great, so is the bedroom and balcony!! Definitely recommend staying here!"
26686783,Jenn,5,"This was in the perfect location for walking the city of Toronto. The condo included just the basics for our stay, but that was all we needed. Peter was quick to respond with any inquiries and was helpful by giving tips for parking and activities close by."
26686783,Ariana,3,Amazing location with wonderful views! Prime location within walking distance of plenty.
26686783,Luke,1,"I'm sure this place was nice when it was first made an air bnb, but that's not really the case anymore. The location was great and  just about everything was walking distance that we wanted to do, but that was the only thing that I would consider accurate about this listing.

The place has not been upkept well, besides the basic cleaning. Drainage was not good as the tub or sink would fill up with water very very quickly. I had to turn the shower off in the middle of a shower before it turned into a bath. There was also a stain on the mattress and the bed frame was insanely squeaky. Very bare minimum kitchenware, trashbags, paper towels as well.

The biggest issue was the false advertising about pool and gym access. The building we stayed at said they do not allow air bnb to give guests access to these amenities anymore.

Peter was also a very slow responder, especially about crucial questions involving parking, amenities, etc while we were there.

Overall, our experience with Peter and his air bnb were very disappointing. If you need a place to stay, the location is great, but that's about it. I would look elsewhere to get a more responsive host who actually occasionally fixes problems with his air bnb."
26749801,Abbey,5,Great place for a quick stay.
26749801,Sasha,5,"Farhadâ€™s place is conveniently located in east york with Plenty of great restaurants to choose from. The place is immaculate, definitely the best place Iâ€™ve stayed in. Highly recommend this great host. Cheers!"
26749801,Cody,5,"Near subway stop, cool space, clean. I would highly recommend"
26749801,Peter,4,Farhad's place is comfortable and in an ethnically diverse area of Toronto. He was very accommodating to us in letting us check in a little early.  My fiancee and I enjoyed the place. It was at the end of August so the place was a little stuffy but opening the windows let some fresh air in. No screens on the windows but fortunately no bugs came in.  The place is near a restaurant which has a delivery truck coming in at 7:30 am but we weren't planning on sleeping in so it wasn't too much of a disturbance.  We were able to cook a basic meal and the fridge was large enough to hold anything.  No ice-maker and just a small ice cube tray so adapt if you like a lot of ice. Would recommend for a good value for money.
26749801,Been,4,"Farhadâ€™s place was good for a quick trip in Toronto. The space was clean and had nice amenities such as free parking and onsite laundry. Thereâ€™s also a Metro (grocery store) right across the street and was close to a lot of restaurants as well. Thanks, Farhad!"
26770106,Ben,5,"The place was very clean. Had all of the basic amenities one could expect. 

The location cannot be beat. Everything is workable from this location. 

Thanks for a great stay."
26770106,Sandy,5,"Great location, small but well-equiped. Recommend to short stay travelers."
26770106,Steve,5,We had a great stay at the Cozy Studio! Good value and great location. We look for unpretentious accommodations like Huan's studio and will look to stay here again for a future trip to Toronto.
26770106,Erika,5,Great place and location for a few nights!
26770106,Dr. Lyron H.,3,The place is centrally locates near great Resturantâ€™s and Huan is very accommodating! It could use deep cleaning of the floor and rug and a coat of paint.
27058296,Jim,5,Great place and hosts!
27058296,Chloe,5,Great view and location. Easy check in process and great communication from host
27058296,Barry,5,"This condo was great, itâ€™s close to so many restaurant and the cn tower. Would recommend."
27058296,Jordan,2,Good
27058296,Adderlyn,3,"Greatest location in Toronto, hands down! Amazing views, modern layout and finishes - perfect! Fell apart on cleanliness but still definitely recommend."
27437787,Avi,5,"The apartment itself is fantastic. Gorgeous view of the city, ground coffee ready to brew, and a stylish modern comfortable interior. Great location as well near transit and the main library and museums. 
The building itself is kind of weird -- it seems to be all AirBNB rentals with multiple teenager parties happening in other rooms, and there was a dried up piece of dog poop in one of the building's common area hallways for two days of our stay until we personally cleaned it. The building staff did not seem to like the steady flow of AirBNB guests but were still kind and helpful."
27437787,Kendyl,4,"Beautiful place, right in the heart of Yorkville.  Tons of great stores, restaurants and bars right around the corner.  The wifi did not work for us, though which was unfortunate.  Would stay here again!"
27437787,Wendy,4,Be aware that the washer/dryer is one unit. Anything more than 4 articles of clothing will take multiple hours to finish. Wifi only worked for part of the time with no resolution. The whole building is on same central air. The building gets extremely warm in the winter and the only way to cool it off is to open the windows and turn off thermostat. Streets are really noisy at night so bring earplugs. Location was excellent. Easy to get to subway and most areas. Very central and in nice neighborhood. Building seems new and is very clean in common areas. Felt very safe and comfortable.
27437787,Sachin,3,Cleanliness is of concern
27437787,Davonte,2,WiFi did not work and no one would respond to our messages.
27495034,Allison,5,Great place!
27495034,Natalie,5,"Staying here was wonderful. It was about a 20 minute walk to the Roger's center and a half hour walk to Scotiabank arena.  There are plenty of restaurants around and picking up the keys was easy even though it was about 3 blocks away (about a 10 minute walk). There is parking available nearby, also about a 10 minute walk, that we played $13 to park there over night.  It was very clean and was perfect for an overnight stay."
27495034,Kimberley,4,"Nice clean property. Studio condo. Good location, parking is a little far"
27495034,Kumara Manoj,4,"I could have given a 5 star, but had some issues with the keycafe while checking in, but apart from that stay was great."
27503620,Michelle,5,"A great value and lovely space while in Toronto. The view is wonderful, space is clean, the host is friendly, and the city is walkable and in reach at this location."
27503620,Lauren,5,We had a great stay! The unit was in a great location with lots to do in walking distance. There was also a great view of the city and lake. We also appreciated the small things like water in the fridge and a well stocked kitchen
27503620,Lu,5,It was a great experience! The location is great.
27503620,Delene & Killick,5,We had a comfortable stay and experienced our hosts being very accommodating for our delayed very-late-night arrival. Too short but restful visit...
27503620,Colleen,5,"Sekar's place was perfect for a short stay in the city. It was close to everything I wanted to see, very clean & convenient to navigate. I would definitely stay here again for my next visit! Thank you!"
27582013,Wade,5,Great host!
27582013,Michael,5,Quick responses and great location! My wife and I had a great time in Toronto.
27582013,Jennifer,5,"Beautiful, tree lined neighborhood, on street parking and easy, private check in all at an affordable price."
27582013,Partha,5,Nik's place was really comfortable. I was a solo traveler and it met my expectation. Highly recommended if you are a solo traveler or travelling with your partner.
27582013,Kevin,5,The locations of this place was well worth the value.  There is parking available and walking distance to upper Yonge Street stores.  The apartment was clean and offered amenities that made our stay convenient.
27705416,Drake,5,"This apartment was very clean and had a great location by the lake! The host was very descriptive with checking and check out, which made the process exceptionally easy!"
27705416,Chantae,5,"Adam's place is in an ideal location. Close to several stores, restaurants, and ""other"" merchants. This was a great 1st trip to Toronto. I will definitely look to book this apartment again when I return."
27705416,Tracy,4,"Great place, spotlessly clean."
27705416,Shannon,3,"Exactly as the picture shows, great location, great view."
27705416,Tarik,1,The place Iâ€™ve very small and uncomfortable. Owner is rude and unprofessional
27721227,Jonah,5,BEAUTIFUL VIEW and FANTASTIC HOST!!!
27721227,Jene,5,"Peter is an excellent host who is communicative and gives thoughtful, well-planned, and easy to follow instructions for check-in. I would recommend this stylish studio to anyone looking for a place to stay in Toronto."
27721227,Gabrielle,5,"Clean, stylish spot in a great location, with a beautiful view!"
27721227,Nataliya,5,Excellent location with a stunning view to the tower and the water. Really enjoyed our stay. Host was very quick to respond to messages.
27721227,Michael,4,Breathtaking views and amazing location! Walkable to everything Toronto has to offer!
27876543,Phillip,5,The best deal north America
27876543,Manish,5,"One of the best Airbnbs I've stayed in for work in the Toronto area. Super clean, great setup in a high-rise condo with a great view, and amazing location. And the price was awesome too!

Loved this Airbnb."
27876543,Raffaella,5,"Great views and location - especially if you want to visit the CN Tower, Aquarium, or have an event at the Toronto Convention Center. Very responsive host."
27876543,Brittney,4,"This place was absolutely awesome location and view, unbeatable for the price. The hosts were so helpful and responsive! My only reason for giving it 4 stars is that the unit was clean but not spotless and also smelled horribly of marijuana smoke upon entry and required airing out. The apartment has a beautiful design and view but the furnishings are very basic. Overall would recommend this unit as for the price the location and view is amazing!"
27876543,Ali,4,Very nice stay
27980430,Graciela,5,"This place is awesome! I highly recommend to anyone visiting Toronto. 
The room was more than perfect! Clean, a lot of space, good amenities and about the decoration, no words! â¤
If I will visit Toronto again, I will stay with you again guys. Thanks!"
27980430,Grace,5,The place was very clean and the staff was so friendly!
27980430,Tedy,4,"The place, the location and the employees were perfect. Talking about the location it is a great  one...very close to any kind of transportation, very close to the downtown, very close to attractions. The employees of the hotel are very helpful, friendly and very polite...5 stars for them. Now talking about the place itself, our room was very clean and it touched our expectations. Now talking about the issues we had 2: when me and my girlfriend arrived at the hotel somwhere around 11pm, after 20 hours of travelling, of course we were very tired and we were just waiting to sleep, but we were supposed to wait at the front desk for 40 minutes!!! The front desk guy was upstairs helping a customer with the TV. I understand it wasn't his fault, but at least he could have left a ticket on the desk like ""I will be back in 20 minutes"", so in that way we could have known. And the second annoying incident happened exactly next morning. We put on our door the ""do not disturb"" sign, but somwhere around 9 am ,while we were still sleeping, we just heard somebody who was using a drilling machine and a grinder tool right next to our room. The sound was terrible and of course it woke us up. As I said, we were very tired and we were trying to sleep, but because of this event our sleep just stopped. Beside these events everything was perfect, but in the future I would advice the owners to pay more attentions to incidents like this. Thank you!"
27980430,Jonathan,4,"Great little place for the money. The room was cozy and clean. Would stay here again. A little bit away from some destinations, but Toronto is easy to get around in. Downtown is a 15 min walk, and public transit is abundant."
27980430,Sarah,4,"We enjoyed our stay here. The room and bathroom were clean. Check in process was smooth. They even had our room ready early. We were able to park on site for $20, which was very convenient. We walked to the downtown area a bit. Had dinner at The Blake House. Itâ€™s walking distance and the food and drinks were excellent."
28103946,Tyler,5,"This condo is an incredible location in downtown Toronto with some incredible views of the city! From this unit, youâ€™re pretty much able to walk anywhere in the vicinity of downtown. I would stay here again on my next visit to Toronto!"
28103946,Emmanuel,5,Outstanding place and perfect location for one or two people looking to stay in the heart of Downtown Toronto.
28103946,Alicia,5,Great place at a great location!

28368298,Mark,5,"Sparkling clean, super convenient, awesome views, great communication, would rent from again"
28368298,Adam,5,amazing place in a great location. very clean and spacious for two people. check in was seamless and emmy was a pleasure to deal with :)

28368298,Travis,5,"Great place, enjoyed my stay, easy check in with short notice Emmie was very helpful."
28455332,Roger,5,Nancy had a great place. The check in was easy and it was at a comfortable location for me
28455332,Jon,5,"For the price, this place delivers a lot. Yes, it's a shared bathroom and the room is pretty small, but considering the price it's a great deal."
28455332,Tiffany,5,It was my first time in Toronto for a little solo traveling. Nancy was good at communicating the check-in details and I liked that I had a place to drop off my bags as soon as I arrived in the morning. The place was located in a good location that made exploring the city very easy. It was a clean and comfortable place to return to after a long day. I would recommend this place to fellow solo travelers.
28455332,Lucie,5,Good location and nice room. Highly recommend!
28455332,En,4,"Great location, great value!"

28566082,Aoife,5,"Great location, perfect place to base yourself for a weekend exploring the city! Close to everything!"
28566082,Peixe,4,"It was a very nice and stylish place. It was cozy, and very close to the Dufferin station. Rosie was very quick to respond to my phone calls. It is a nice place for a short stay, for one to two people."
28566082,Maddie,4,"Very clean space! I had a slight issue with the check-in process of not having the right key in the lock box, but it was resolved within ten minutes of arrival. There is a coffee shop right next door which is great. The space is small, but not much smaller than a typical hotel room; both myself and fiancÃ© were very comfortable there for the weekend. This is a very walkable neighborhood. We were able to park on the street  just around the corner the whole weekend without getting a ticket. On the Toronto city website, the rule is 3 hr street parking, but only enforced if someone complains. 10 minute walk from cool stores, bars, and a few improv theaters. You can't beat this price for such a clean and convenient space."
28566082,Constance,4,"Location is perfect - walking distance to places to eat and things to do on Bloor. Place is clean, and tidy. Wouldnâ€™t have more than 2 people due to size, but it was perfect for our trip."
28952946,Noreen,5,"The location was perfect.  Walking distance to the train station,  trolley,  wharf, shopping and restaurants."
28952946,Akime,5,Communicative. On time. Respectful. Love staying here. Iâ€™d recommend it to anyone
28952946,Mason,5,Sam was a great host! Very informative and quick to respond to any of our inquiries! The flat was the perfect size and had some great views! We highly recommend this location for a getaway to any Toronto visitors!
28952946,Anamika,5,"Sam, went above and beyond to make my stay comfortable. My flight was 3 hrs late and I was eel beyond late for check in. Sam was very considerate and caring. Apartment was sparkling clean too! I hope to stay there in the future as well!"
28952946,Bill,5,"I liked having a nice, clean  place to stay with a good view and two nearby markets to get food to make some meals. There was a handy place outside to  rent a bike to get around town on too."
28963462,Tim,5,"Great location, exactly what I needed!"
28963462,Jessica,5,Incredibly responsive and willing to help! Enjoyed the area and Toronto!
28963462,Karina,5,"I stayed at Spencerâ€™s private suite for 3 nights and enjoyed my stay. Communication was great and he responds quickly! If I am back in Toronto, I would definitely consider booking his place again. I like the pin pad entrance. Over all a very smooth stay. There is also parking available for an extra charge which was super convenient considering there is no overnight street parking. I recomendable this place!"
28963462,Alexis,5,"Spencerâ€™s place was very quaint and clean. The location was great; walking distance to local restaurants, cafes and parks. I also really appreciated how quick he was to respond to messages! I would highly recommend this spot for a quick visit to Toronto!"
28963462,Andrew,3,Decent stay not very far distance from downtown.
28964371,Vishal,5,Great location! Amenities are close by. I would stay again and recommend to friends and family.
28964371,Myrian,5,"The view was amazing, waking up to it everyday is a terrific way to start the day.
Having some toiletries and kitchenware available is a really nice touch. The place felt like home and had a nice modern look to it.

Absolutely loved our stay and everyone was nice and helpful.  The information booklet is pretty spot on.  Would definitely recommend this place while visiting Toronto!"
28964371,Jonathan,5,"This was a great apartment for my stay in Toronto. The self check-in process was easy, loved having a spot to park the car, and the view from the apartment is great. This is a bit further west of York Street than I've stayed in the past, but Union Station was totally walk-able, and I even walked to the St. Lawrence market from the apartment. However,  there is a bus stop literally steps from the front door if you don't want to walk, so it is super convenient to get around."
28964371,Jesse,5,10/10 would recommend!
28964371,Joel,4,Great place to stay
29010310,Frehiwet,5,"Clean, beautiful place with an amazing view...Zain was very responsive. We enjoyed our stay."
29010310,Marci,5,"Fahad was a great host and very hospitable. The location was also in an awesome spot, walking distance to most parts of the city. Amazing view from their balcony. The cats and dog were also super friendly!"
29010310,Kaveesh,5,"Highly Appreciated the way of talking & An amazing place , Nice view of the place, 100% worth of the money, Highly recommended this place for the Downtown area"
29010310,Barbara,5,They were very accommodating to my special circumstances. I had a pleasant stay.
29010310,Colleen,5,10 stars for location! Views can't be beaten and short walk to all fun things.
29422248,Jontay,5,Itâ€™s a great place & close to everything
29422248,Caitlin,5,"Convenient, clean space with great communication. Perfect for a weekend trip!"
29422248,Nicole,5,"Very easy communication for a quick trip. Clean and efficient, would recommend!"
29422248,Daniel,5,"A great stay to relax and recharge after being out and about exploring the city. The listing was accurate to what I experienced during my stay â€” very clean and simple furnishings, not too much clutter. Conveniently near some restaurants and markets. 

Communication with Sheng was great and everything with check-in and check-out was clear and easy."
29480423,Vinka,5,Beautiful place!
29480423,Toni,5,Great stay
29480423,Michael,5,Fantastic venue! Highly recommended. Very sleek and stylish. Hopefully one day if I stay in Toronto I can stay here again.
29480423,Julian,5,"Great place to stay, host was very quick with responses. Amazing view!! Loved the inside. I would definitely would stay there again the next time Iâ€™m in Toronto!"
29480423,Brooklyn,4,We have a great stay with nice restaurants and a great view
29519489,Jeff,5,Sheng left very clear check-in instructions and parking tips for her guests. Highly recommend for anyone who is staying in the East Chinatown area
29519489,Krystal,5,"Very clean, easy to locate and close to everything"
29519489,Shawnee,5,Very clean and quiet building!  Safe and secure check in with the keypad and lock box.  Lots of good food around the neighborhood!
29519489,Smargolin,5,"Sheng's place is very clean and comfortable. In a fun location with easy access to public transport and walkable to some attractions. If you're looking for places in Toronto, I highly recommend."
29519489,Angelo,1,"The area is pretty close to downtown and the room on the inside looks decent but I didnâ€™t like several things.

For one the description is misleading. It says ENTIRE PLACE but there is multiple rooms in this building. The hallway is not like an apartment hallway. Itâ€™s more like a hallway in a house. All of which are located downstairs on a basement level. I didnâ€™t like the fact that there is a kitchen in the hallway that everyone staying in the building uses and you can hear everything that is going on. I was woken up a few times from a nap because someone was cooking and I heard the pots and pans etc... Also, there is no window at all and you cannot control the AC or Heat as they have it set to whatever they feel is comfortable for them. They did supply a fan tho. Also, the owners are Asian and I didnâ€™t like their attitudes when I approached them to say hi or ask a question. I would not book this place again."
29613234,Jeremy,5,Very nice place. Noura was a great help.
29613234,Simon,5,"Noura's place was great! Walking distance to restaurants and the airport, clean and modern, awesome wall of windows. Definitely recommend it."
29613234,Christopher,5,Excellent place in a great location.
29613234,Ravi,5,"Noura was an excellent host, extremely communicative and helpful. We had no issues staying in her lovely place, and the location, decor,  and views were all fabulous. Exactly as pictured and worth the value. Had a great stay, and will def look out to stay here again next time im in Toronto.

Thanks!"
29613234,Filipa,4,Perfect view of the CN tour from the balcony. Stylish apartment. I just wish the bed was more comfortable to be perfect.
29704947,Jade,5,The view of the city and CN Tower from this apartment  is truly magnificent. It is good size apartment and is very clean. Washer and dyer inside the apartment.
29704947,Wendy,5,"Great location! Incredible view! Comfy bed. Definitely recommend Tabs condo! Perfect for shows at Scotiabank Arena. Once you figure out parking garage, keys and security, you wonâ€™t want to stay anywhere else!"
29704947,Jason,5,Excellent location. Incredible views. Spotless and comfortable accommodations.
29704947,Eduardo,5,The location of this units is perfect. Close to everything in down town. The unit is 44 floor so the view in the morning and at night are amazing.
29704947,Shantel,1,If you like to spend money without having an actual place to stay then I highly recommend this venue.  Host left us stranded at the airport with no address and no method for check in even after numerous contact attempts from Air BnB staff.
29831676,Zachary,5,Great stay! Far walks to places but was manageable. Great restaurants near by!!!
29831676,Aubrey,5,Great value and great location with close proximity to many Toronto attractions. Very quick responses from host and we would definitely stay again!

29928960,Hailey,5,Great place for the price! The house was clean and well maintained. Perfect for our wedding weekend getaway!
29928960,Shiyi,5,It's a nice place! Very convenient. Walkable distance to anywhere in downtown Toronto
29928960,Karin,5,Very convenient place to stay in Toronto!  Thanks!
29928960,Jenna,5,Huan's place was a cozy place to relax after long days of adventure and travel. The city is within walking distance and there were many places to eat or access public transportation nearby. Quick responses made us feel at ease if we had any questions about the area or the apartment. Would definitely recommend this clean and quiet space!
29928960,Carolann,4,Great location! Cute space that's walking distance to downtown Toronto and Yunge street. Easy check in and check out. Location is ideal to explore.
30129741,Andrea,5,Great location with a heck of a view.
30129741,Austin,5,Wonderful location! Very convenient walking distance to just about everything I wanted to see in Toronto.
30129741,Nerissa,5,"Stunning!!!

The apartment was super clean and beautifully decorated plus the view was amazing!  Check-In was fast and simple - the host was very responsive throughout the duration of my stay.  I would recommend to anyone looking for a convenient + trendy spot downtown!"
30129741,Milton,5,Cool space...great location/view
30129741,Jade,4,Josephâ€™s place is very nice. Only the bedroom was a little dirty.
30274164,Celeste,5,Great place to stay and affordable!
30274164,Juliana,5,Very clean and great location! Quick responses and helpful.
30274164,Lea,5,"Perfect location to explore Toronto, close to public transportation, clean and nice place, good for four people, good communication"
30274164,Bethany,5,This was our first experience with Airbnb and it couldnâ€™t of been better! Easy to get to and the check-in and checkout process was simple. Everything was just as the pictures showed and the location was amazing! Your able to walk right out the door to the Streetcar that goes directly Downtown and runs 24hrs! Many shops and restaurants close by was an added plus! I felt extremely safe and everyone was so kind. I will be referring all my friends and I myself canâ€™t wait to go back!
30274164,Elizabeth,5,"Anna and Lindaâ€™s place was a great place to stay during our visit in Toronto. The apartment was clean, stylish, and cute! It is conveniently located near many restaurants and to public transit, which was great. The apartment was just slightly smaller than we anticipated, but nonetheless we were very comfortable there. Would definitely recommend it!"
30424472,Anna,5,Tonys place has awesome views and is nicely put together. I enjoyed the location and check in was a breeze!
30424472,Derek,5,Very lovely place.
30424472,Perry,5,Tony was very communicative and his place was incredibly nice (loved the views and the location)! Great spot for a quick business trip and would recommend to any travelers looking to explore Toronto.
30424472,Robert,5,Amazing location with all the amenities makes Tony's condo a great place to stay for work trips.
30424472,Brandon,5,"Amazing views of the city, such a stylish place to stay. Super comfortable and Tony took care of everything to make the stay perfect. Couldnâ€™t recommend it more."
30476433,Nathan,5,The ad is accurate and the space is stylish and extremely clean. Above average bed size and comfort compared to many AirBnBs I have stayed in. We barely had any time in Toronto but we got around fairly easily from the location. Communication was good and the check in and out were painless.
30476433,Melissa,5,Llona place is exactly what it is described to be in the listing. Very spacious and clean. Llona and her co-host Chamil was also very responsive to all of our questions and needs before and during our stay in Toronto.
30476433,Shannon,4,This place was light and bright as described.  Very clean.  Check in and check out were seamless.
30476433,Trent,4,The place was pretty clean and was exactly as pictured. Easy location with parking. Good spot for a night.
30476433,Deborah,3,"Apartment was clean and as described. It is a good location, convenient to eateries and stores and was very comfortable. But be aware that the floor is unleveled (especially in bedroom area) and it may cause a sense of disorientation or like you are off balance. 
Also this is good for a night or if you donâ€™t really plan on cooking. Very minimal cooking utensils or pots."
30567717,James,5,Beautiful view!
30567717,Shahed,5,"Mike's Place is at an excellent location, walking distance from Union Station and main attractions, also very clean. The check-in process was very smooth and they were able to accommodate my late check-in, Highly recommend Mike's apartment."
30567717,Harris,5,"You will not be disappointed, go ahead and book!"
30567717,John,5,"We had a great time. Traveled for the Bruins game. 5min walk from the arena. Very close to the waterfront and CN tower, as well as Union Station. Would highly recommend! Also great communication."
30567717,Cameron,5,"Great price for an amazing location and condo! So close to great attractions such as Scotiabank Arena and CN tower! Grocery, restaurants, coffee and shopping were very close. As someone with a lot of patience, Itâ€™s a 60+ floor building and the elevators can SOMETIMES  make you wait a long time. But other than that, amazing place that i highly recommended."
31591821,Erik,5,"Excellent communication, perfect location, off street parking was clutch. Spencer is exactly the type of person you want to do business with. 5 stars."
31591821,Robert,5,Good value in a good location
31591821,Scott,5,"Location is above all the best feature of my most recent stay. So close to various shops, restaurants and nightlife. Extremely convenient!"
31591821,Adam,4,"Spencer's place is in an excellent location. You can easily walk to Kensington Market, Chinatown, Trinity Bellwoods, and downtown. Apartment is very large. There is some street noise as it's right on West Queen but it wasn't too bad."
31591821,Redwood,3,"The location can't be beat that's for sure. Overall I had a comfortable stay at this queens street apartment.  Despite my admittedly higher standard of cleanliness and less party centric purpose of visit, I loved being centrally located.  The attention to detail regarding cleanliness leaves a bit to be desired but with Airbnb playing a pivotal role in the the affordability of rental places in big cities like Toronto,  you're invited to take what you can get at a value. All well and good but it's ok to recognize that something gets lost in that transaction. I reckon I might pony up the xxxtra $$ for the gentrifying spot on king street but wish i was less forced to make choices as such. Dont get me wrong, you'll sleep well here because you can afford to. Spencer is a very responsive host with well intentioned listings a plenty."
31795864,Alexis,5,"Loved this place! The room is at The Pembroke Inn. Yes, the rooms are small â€” itâ€™s a boutique hotel â€”  but itâ€™s really all you need for a stay in Toronto if you plan on venturing out! The space was super clean and really cute. I will definitely be back again and I recommend it to anybody going for a trip to Toronto. :)"
31795864,Paul,5,Great location for taking in the amenities and entertainment of the Church and Wellsley area.  Front desk is very friendly and accommodating.  Parking fee was very reasonable an a big plus.  Room is small but very comfortable.  Highly recommend for those looking for a good bargain in Toronto!
31795864,Alexis,4,"Great place to stay for a quick get away, not too expensive."
31795864,Natalie,4,"This spot is a great bargain if you're looking for a place to stay within walking distance of most of Toronto's big sites. The room was stylish and well put together. The room was small, but not too small for two people. The mini fridge in the room was awesome to have because it provided a lot of space for our own food. 

Staff was friendly and very helpful. They held our luggage while we waited for check-in time, and they helped us carry it all up the stairs. Lovely! During our stay they were renovating part of the facade of the building so the courtyard was a bit messy. However, it looked like it would be a great place to hangout once its all done. 

The Inn is certainly a good bargain, but you shouldn't come here expecting perfection. Its perfect for anyone travelling on a budget, but if you're looking for an EXPERIENCE, I'd look elsewhere. 

If I find myself in the Toronto area in the future, I'd certainly stay here again."
31795864,Jorell,2,"The location is great, walking distance from the mall and other transit options. One issue - bed bugs."
32088956,Ernesto,5,Brian is an amazing host and his place is perfect!
32088956,Gail,5,"Everything is great about this place.  It's in a superb location, it's immaculate, the view is spectacular, and the room is comfortable and quiet.  Brian is an outstanding host - friendly and helpful without being intrusive.  I hope to be able to go back and stay in his place again."
32088956,Amanda,5,"Brianâ€™s place had a beautiful view of the lake, and the room itself was very clean and comfortable. The building is just a 5 min walk from union station, the convention center, and the waterfront. Brian was a great host, and was very friendly and welcoming! I would highly recommend!"
32088956,Jennifer,5,"Brian was an excellent host! 

My husband and I had booked a different Airbnb. That host cancelled on us 2 days before our trip, leaving us with little options available on Labor Day weekend. Luckily Brianâ€™s place was still available and Airbnb was very accommodating by helping us getting in touch with Brian (who was very responsive and polite). Brianâ€™s place was beautiful and clean. He was a very welcoming host. The view outside our window was incredible; we were downtown right in the middle of everything. We would stay there again!"
32088956,Tab,4,A great location! Very close to Union station and Toronto islands.
32232905,Amber,5,Perfect location with an urban feel
32232905,Kerri,5,Had a wonderful stay at this lovely studio with my sister! Perfect size for two. Sparkling clean space. Peaceful sleep with the fireplace. The location was exactly what we were looking for in terms of spending one day in the city exploring shops and restaurants. Check in was made easy by Luisa and parking was affordable. Hope to visit again sometime soon!
32232905,Andrew,5,This place was perfect for a one night stay! Not too far for downtown Toronto. Easy checkin plus clean and spacious. I would for sure book again!
32232905,Kevin,5,"The apartment was very clean and comfortable. The location is nice, with a bus right at the corner and some good bars and restaurants nearby. Great bang for your buck!"
32232905,Logan,5,Great space and location! Neighbor is a little noisy but wasnâ€™t a big issue. Would recommend
32271402,Nick,5,Great!
32271402,Daniel,5,"Great, clean, convenient. 10/10 would stay again."
32271402,Maggie,5,"Had a great stay.  The apartment was very clean, easy to check in, close to stores and public transit. I would highly recommend and stay here again!"
32271402,Tatiana,5,"The space was just like what was shown. Itâ€™s a great place to stay and close to the city center. 20m in an Uber and thereâ€™s a lot of surrounding local transportation to get you there. It was super easy to access the apartment. When I arrived the place was sparkling clean - and super quiet. I really love this space and would definitely book again. Sheng was very attentive to my needs of dropping my luggage off earlier than the check in time. 

Thank you so much Sheng!"
32271402,Tiffany,3,"Overall, this isnâ€™t somewhere Iâ€™d recommend to a friend. As a woman, Iâ€™d probably feel unsafe staying here alone since the room was in the basement with no service (WiFi was available and worked well, but that makes phone calls difficult if not to another iPhone) and windows that face the hallway. 

It was quick and cheap to Uber to other parts of the city from here, but if youâ€™re looking for cool bars or restaurants within walking distance, this isnâ€™t a good spot. 

The parking was convenient being right across the street and it wasnâ€™t too expensive. 

My biggest gripe is that the air in the Airbnb had a ton of moisture in it.. it made everything feel damp and/or sticky (including us). This made sleeping comfortably very difficult. Sheng did offer a fan (which we took) and new bedding (which we didnâ€™t because we donâ€™t feel it would have made a difference due to the environment), which helped a little, but not nearly enough to sleep well. As a result, we were exhausted after 4 days (3 nights) here, and we actually left a day earlier than what we paid."
32387616,Jeremy,5,Newman was great! Prompt responses. Loved the condo. Great location and easy directions from Newman. Thanks again!
32387616,Stephanie,5,"This was the perfect space for our long weekend! From the beginning, Newman thoroughly communicated with us and, upon arrival, continued to check-in to ensure we were comfortable. I'll definitely recommend this spot to any friends traveling to Toronto!"
32387616,Brendon,5,"Close to everything in the entertainment district, CN tower, Scotia Bank arena, hockey hall of fame and many more. Clean quiet condo with enough to make your stay worthwhile. Newman was quick with responses and check in as well as hints on where to explore. Absolutely recommend this property and Newman as a great value."
32387616,Don & Ming,5,"Excellent location. We literally walked to most of attractions. For places that are farther we were able to catch subways and trains in short distance. 

We enjoyed Newmanâ€™s place very much."
32387616,Jeremiah,4,"Quiet, easy access with good location to downtown establishments, convention center, Rogers Center, CN Tower and ScotiaBank Arena.  Nice grocery store right across the street, didn't find until day 2."
32388246,Michael,5,Great location and host!  Highly recommend this property!
32388246,Grace,5,"Highly recommend this place! Super clean and very modern. We had no issues whatsoever. Perfect for our stay in Toronto and close to lots of activities and restaurants. And we loved the balcony too,  just wish there were chairs! But overall probably the best Airbnb I have had so far!"
32388246,Amanda Angeline,5,"Excellent location within walking distance to everything. There is a affordable paid parking garage next door! 
Easy check in process with great instructions and communication. 
Would highly recommend!"
32388246,Jared,4,"Modern space in an ideal location. Has everything you need, and definitely clean, though could be better maintained (a few household items needed repair). Communication with Trace was a bit difficult, but fortunately check-in and check-out were painless. Would stay again, but hopefully they make a few minor improvements to their procedures."
32388246,Michael,3,"Pros: 
- Amazing location close to everything 
- Fairly clean aside from dirty carpet
- big patio (though no furniture)
- plenty of extra sheets and bedding
- modern place with hardwood floors and solid kitchen and bathroom

Cons:
- non responsive via text, must call
- elevators took 10+ min 
- never fixed missing blinds despite sending pics
- too much light
- rude front desk worker (bigger dude with short dark hair)
- no privacy from neighbors as you can hat everything and can see each other when they are outside on their patio
- washing machine wouldnâ€™t work half the time 
- a bunch of stuff leftover from past guests..(bud light and wine in the freezer) 


Overall, location alone might be worth booking if you can deal with other stuff"
32765944,Derek,5,Great value for the money. View was great. Location was perfect.  Everything we wanted to do was within walking distance.
32765944,Martin,5,"Amazing condo with a great view and in a convenient location. The place is small but very cozy. We will definitely stay here again. The building is very busy, so make sure to have enough time when using the elevators."
32765944,John,5,"Check in was extremely easy and Newman was always quick to respond to any message. The spot is in a great location downtown, very central."
32765944,April,5,Newman was extremely quick with communications. His instructions were spot on and he even warned me of current construction in the area. His condo was impeccable! So beautiful! I loved the added little touches and the amazing scent. It was elegant yet homey. I would highly recommend Newman and his properties.
32765944,Eric,3,"The condo was a cool place to stay, in downtown Toronto, in a high rise with a great view. Unlike any place I've ever stayed. Inside it had everything you'd need on even an extended stay. It was, however, stressful finding parking and figuring out where to go. Also, the security at the place is a bit much, stopping us and making us sit while they checked to make sure we were authorized to be there, which also added stress to the stay. In addition, the bed was a bit small for the 2 of us and was not very comfortable."
32769906,Dimitri,5,Emmieâ€™s spot is ideal!
32769906,Wendy,5,Emmie's place was great! Very detailed & easy check-in process. Amazing views & the parking that's included was super convenient.
32769906,Alexandra,5,Wonderful place and great views. The location was perfect because everything is close by. Instructions for check-in and parking were easy and clear. Would definitely recommend!
32769906,Nalene,5,"Amazing location, great view! The place itself was perfect for what we needed. Will
Use again for sure!!"
32769906,Emily,4,"Emmie's place was very stylish and fun, just a few blocks from public transit. The view from the condo was amazing! We had some difficulties parking in the garage on the property because of a key fob not working. However, this was through no fault of our host and she was very communicative and accommodating to us.
We really loved the Liberty Village neighborhood, which was a short walk to a few restaurants and bars that we really enjoyed. Overall, we had a really great time here!"
33348893,James,5,Great place! Amazing views! Close to everything! (10-20 min walks)
33348893,Caroline,5,"Alexaâ€™s spot is everything as advertised- impeccable style and a complete rock star view makes her pad the perfect way to experience Toronto! Convenient places like Starbucks, pharmacy are all right there.  You are virtually right near everything the city has to offer"
33348893,Bob,5,"Fantastic penthouse in the heart of Toronto. Easy access by transit or ride share to many fun nhoods, and very walkable to Chinatown. The balcony and views are superb. Highly recommend and would stay again!"
33348893,Andrew,5,"Easy check-in, extremely clean apartment with beautiful views of the city. Highly recommend!"
33743028,Lauren,5,Great accommodation! Great location! Amazing hosts! Clean! Free breakfast and soda and water! I will definitely come back! I recommend this place 100%! :)
33743028,Chris,5,Great central location close to downtown.  A short walk to public transportation.  Clean room.
33743028,Jenna,5,"Great location, easy to access much of the city!"
33743028,Amanda,5,"Extremely friendly staff who seemed to genuinely care about their guests. The building is super cute and the room was clean and had everything we needed. Location was awesome, Allen Garden conservatory is a 3 min walk away and Phoenix Concert Hall was about a 7-10 min walk. 
We will definitely stay here again if we visit Toronto in the future!!"
33743028,Marco,1,It was too small and we literally felt Unwelcome by the hosts. Wonâ€™t be returning or recommending
33931772,Iryna,5,Great place. Great service.
33931772,Javauni,5,"5/5 would recommend the Pembroke Inn to anyone staying in downtown Toronto. The location is easily accessible to transportation and downtown venues, restaurants, and hotspots. The ambiance and interior design of the Inn is the intersection of modern, minimalist, and rustic. The room was clean and space was efficiently utilized. That staff are inviting, hospitable, and responsive to questions. And all of this with breakfast included. If youâ€™re questioning whether the Pembroke Inn is the place to stay for a weekend getaway or an overnighter in downtown Toronto? Iâ€™d say do it - itâ€™s the responsible thing to do."
33931772,Eric,5,Just as advertised. Recommended.
33931772,Susanne,5,The room was very clean and the staff at the front desk was awesome. The only challenge for us was having to remove everything from our car since it was near the neighborhood that had the homeless shelters.  I would stay here again.
33931772,Nathan,4,"Great little hotel. The room was a little small, but I didn't really spend any time there. The location was great and street parking was not an issue there."
33997173,Liam,5,"Great place to stay, pretty convenient."
33997173,Lyndsey,5,Lily's place was perfect for our 1 nightstay while passing through the city. Exactly as described!
33997173,Tom,5,This location was VERY clean and well kept. We really enjoyed our stay and felt very comfortable. Would recommend to anyone staying in Toronto.
33997173,Brendan,4,Great place for a stop and go sleep space in Toronto.
33997173,Bry,1,The area in pictures look nice and safe but it was in a downtown ghetto. Far from a safe or nice area and was so rough we didnâ€™t even go in. We immediately left and found a hotel a few blocks away.
34140623,Sabina,5,Wonderful!
34140623,Michelle,5,Convenient and at the right cost for a quick weekend getaway. Everything within driving distance! Clean and breakfast is a plus. Easy parking as well. Staff of friendly.
34140623,Janjaap,5,This is a beautiful place - really great for a short stay. The neighborhood is not the best part of Toronto which we didnâ€™t know as we hadnâ€™t been here prior. We didnâ€™t feel unsafe however it is definitely not the best area but not too far from the center. Would definitely recommend for a night or two but probably not much more ! Really comfortable though (:
34140623,Shubham,4,"Great location, just a 10-15 minutes walk from the Dundas square. Close to bars and food joints.
The place was a little cramped, but very clean and the check in process was easy."
34140623,Carol,4,"This is  a clean, quiet, convenient, comfortable place to stay while in Toronto. It is within walking distance to the downtown area and the special sightseeing bus kiosk on Yonge Street where you can buy one ticket and get on and off at any of the stops. If you are looking for luxury this is not the place but if you are looking for a nice quiet place to relax after a day of exploring this wonderful city this is for you. I particularly loved the Nespresso machine in our room. We awoke to Nespresso and then had a nice filling breakfast in the lobby before our long day of sightseeing. Thumbs up."
34719672,Jessica,5,"Loved this space! It was cute and very clean! Check in was super easy and it was a great location, super close to the Eaton Centre!"
34719672,Dejah,5,Great stay! Conveniently located & cozy dwelling.
34719672,Nate,5,Last minute booking and they were super responsive with info. Cheap and cheerful option for downtown TO.
34719672,Abigail,5,This was a really clean BnB and well-managed. The bed was also super comfy!
34719672,Dr. Lyron H.,5,The place is conveniently located near where I needed to work. The group was quick to respond to my requests.
34829275,Scott,5,"If you are looking for a nice, clean place with a great host & inexpensive. Stop looking, this BnB has it all."
34829275,Jc,5,"Walter was a most congenial, entertaining host who made my stay very memorable.  I look forward a future trip to Toronto and staying at his apartment again."
34829275,Scott,5,"Walter is a very nice man, and very accomidating. For the location, you really cant get much better value. The parking pass thing was a little odd, because of the allotted time you had to put it on the car, and turn it in in the morning. But it sure beats getting a ticket! Thanks again Walter!"
34829275,Richard,5,Walter was very thoughtful and flexible. I will definitely stay there again when visiting Toronto.
34829275,Salin,4,Nice place.
35379698,Quinton,5,"Kevin's place is in the perfect location for any concert goers attending The Phoenix. It is just a 5 minute walk to the venue, and about a 7 minute walk to the Eaton Centre and downtown. The location is great! The staff was also very nice and welcoming at check-in, during the free breakfast and during check-out. I will definitely seek out a room here again in the future."
35379698,Graciela,5,"Awesome place!  Location is perfect. You feel welcome since you access the building. Room was fantastic, newly renovated, clean with all you need to have a perfect stay!  I will recommend you guys!"
35379698,Kimberley,5,"Very nice clean room, more of a European style. Location is in an older hotel but rooms are modern and updated."
35379698,Janice,5,"Our room felt a bit small for two people but the bed was roomy and quite comfortable. The staff at the hotel are very pleasant and helpful, eager to please. The older hotel was charming and the neighborhood interesting."
35483427,Neil,5,"Amazing location, sparkling clean and excellent amenities. Highly recommended!!"
35483427,Allison,5,"Lilyâ€™s Place was perfect: fantastic location, easy communication, lovely touches in the condo. The washer & dryer was absolutely wonderful to have! Lily is a perfect host!"
35483427,David,5,Great place. Very clean.  Great view too - you can see Lake Ontario from the balcony window.  The building concierges were helpful and very friendly.  Check out the gym when you stay too!
35483427,Kasha,5,"10/10 would recommend to anyone. Lilyâ€™s place is extremely clean, comfortable, and the location is perfect for any events at the arena or tourist attractions down town! Check in is very easy and navigating around down town from this location is a breeze."
35483427,Katelyn,5,"Lily's place is super convenient to all the attractions in Toronto. Within walking distance to the CN tower, Ripley's aquarium, Roger's Centre and the waterfront. Directly in front of Union Station, which has a direct line to Pearson Airport, as well as in front of the Scotiabank Arena where I attended a concert. The condo is in the Maple Leaf Square which also has several restaurants and grocery stores underneath the complex. The balcony has views of the CN tower and Lake Ontario."
35735501,Julia,5,Had a great time staying here!
35735501,Emma,5,Great location and easy checkin.
35735501,Thomas,4,No frills studio apartment that is in need of some tlc. Incredible location with very easy check-in / check-out.
35735501,Morgan,3,"This is a small, cute place to stay if youâ€™re only here for the weekend. The place is very small, perfect for no more than 2 people. Walking distance to downtown. Unfortunately there was a charge for parking which I was unaware about until after booking. As well as the TV not working at all after being told it was a smart TV but clearly wasnâ€™t. But the place itself is nice and great location, and easy check-in and check out process."
35735501,Hannah,2,"The location is good and Spencer made check in/out very easy. However, the place itself is quite small and dark and not well maintained or very clean. The bed is uncomfortable and it is not really possible to cook a real meal in the kitchen."
36041006,Francesco,5,"Cheap, clean, and conveniently located. Huan is very easy to communicate with and the check-in is very efficient. A perfect spot to spend a couple of nights in Toronto!"
36041006,Angelyn,5,"This studio apartment is in a great location, the building is well-kept, and the apartment itself is nice. It was small, but for two tourists who were basically only sleeping in the room, it was perfect. Definitely a good value and great experience!"
36041006,Adam,5,Juan was very accommodating and let us drop our bags off at his place before check-in time because I am on crutches. Very cool place with great location in the city. 5/5
36041006,Cristina,5,"Perfect size if youâ€™re going to be out and about on the town! Iâ€™d never been to Toronto so I wasnâ€™t aware of the public street parking rules and hours, so do a little bit of research before your stay and I think youâ€™ll be good!"
36041006,Amanda,5,"This place is exactly what is pictured. The studio apartment is cozy, clean and well perfect. I stayed for 4 days by myself. The location is great; right on  some bus lines and a few blocks from the subway stop. The bed was comfy and the shower has better water pressure than I expected. This apartment would seem small with two adults staying but it was perfect for just me. Huan responded to my messages immediately and assisted me with checking in. If I visit Toronto again, I would stay here."

36168830,Norma,5,This place was perfect for our one night stay. The receptionist was seriously the most incredible guy ever!! He was so so nice and great customer service! He offered to help take our luggage upstairs and to our car. He constantly made sure we were doing ok and making sure we werenâ€™t missing anything. I forgot his name but he truly made us feel safe and at home.
36168830,Kira,3,"The room was not clean, especially the bathroom. My tv did not work. Staff is nice and gave me updates. Room was quiet."

36879409,LeAnn,5,"Spencer is a gracious and prompt host who replies quickly to inquiries. I really enjoyed my stay at the apartment. I was in Toronto for a writing weekend and this was the perfect place to create :) The location was perfect, beautiful views and in a safe neighborhood near so many cool places. Super comfortable bed, fresh linens and nice built in shelves :)  Comfortable living room seating, great television, lots of steaming services and plenty of electrical outlets. The parking was very convenient and the check-in process was simple. Can't wait to come back to Toronto again soon!"
36879409,Joseph,5,"The space was exactly like photos, overall really clean, and in a great part of town. Spencer was very informative and helpful with all of my questions and I really enjoyed my stay!!!"

36879409,Trystan,4,Great spot for a quick get away in a great location.
38292781,John,5,"Nice sized apartment, short walk from where I needed to me. Great experience."
38292781,Joseph,5,"A lovely little basement apartment, not too far of a walk from College Street and the Little Italy neighborhood thoroughfare. Comfy bed, we slept quite well, good outlet access. We weren't in the apartment much to use all of its amenities, but it was comfortable."
38292781,Mary,5,"Super convenient location within walking distance of lots of restaurants and shops. Nice and clean with fantastic blackout curtains. Easy check in, everything was as expected."
38292781,Joe,4,"Great location in Toronto but if you're a light sleeper I wouldn't recommend staying here as it is on a main road. The free parking that is included is awesome! If you're tall, beware, this is a basement apartment with a low ceiling (7ft?) And there is an HVAC run down one size which lowers the ceiling to about 5'8"". I'd definitely stay here again as it's a quick walk to Korean Town, Kensington, and Little Italy. There isn't much to use by way of the kitchen but there are plenty of restaurants within walking distance."
38292781,Emily,3,"This AirBnB is in a nice location, and fairly easy to get into and out of if you drive there. The apartment is very open with a nice kitchen area if needed for your stay."
39292841,Marie,5,"Exactly like the picture! It was really nice staying there, i recommend it!"
39292841,Troy,5,Todd and Jackie were completely hospitable. They answered quickly and provided everything we needed
39292841,"Penny, Hooi Peng",5,"Conveniently located near a subway station.  Sparkling clean and nice decor.  Quick response from the hosts. No issue with the heater, as mentioned by a previous traveller.  This unit is within a building.  Was noisy on my first night but otherwise, perfect.  Will stay there again if I visit Toronto again."
39292841,Michael,4,"Great location, easy access from Public Transit. Clean and comfortable, perfect for a couple nights in Toronto."
39292841,Pooria,4,This was one of the best experiences through booking with Airbnb. It really worths the money. The location is superb. Pretty much accessible to  downtown Toronto. I highly recommend it.
