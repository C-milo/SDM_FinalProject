Different towers within the residence made directions confusing but we discovered a easier way to get to the condo without rerouting through a different floor. Otherwise as expected. A 1 bedroom small studio, stylish and modern but not very roomy.  Very small but doable. We were a group of 4 travelling for Caribana and werent inside much.",0.05576923076923078,Negative

This location could not have been more perfect for us, not only for the Raptors/NBA action (stood right out front for all the first half!), but also so beautifully located within Toronto.  I plan to return with my husband to Toronto, for a full pleasure (no business) trip, and hope we can stay here again.  While small, it was all we needed and the staff at the building were helpful and informative.  Even the cleaning crew (which had not been informed of our noon check-out), were kind and full of hospitality when they arrived and we were not yet gone.  This was a terrific experience and I thank you so much!",0.24546130952380954,Negative

11533218,Joelle,5,"This location in Toronto is PERFECT!  Great view, super close to all things we were interested in seeing and a block away from a Sobey's, which is a fantastic grocery store.  The only thing we wish we knew about previous to going was that the mattress was really firm.  It was actually shockingly firm.  I guess some people like that sort of thing, but we are more into a squishier (word?) mattress.  We ended up purchasing a mattress pillow top because we knew we wouldn't be able to sleep well for the rest of our stay and everything was fine.  Alper responds quickly and was very helpful with a TV issue we had (one of the clickers was under the couch, which we found and everything worked fine after that).  All in all we would rent this space again (which we probably will in the summer to go to a Blue Jays game), but we'll bring our pillow topper with us!",0.2546296296296296,Negative

Very close to groceries and restaurants. The building did appear to be younger, college aged folks and you could hear dogs barking or chatting in the halls/neighboring rooms. The balcony is a lovely space to be able to enjoy the breeze and step out for a quick view. The access to pool and hot tub are a nice amenitily here, although we did not use either so I cannot speak to them.

Overall, the place is just down right nice. No flairs, just everything you want/need. A comfortable and inviting 20th+ floor condo with a stunning view in the heart of a bustling and friendly neighborhood--what else could you ask for?  I can't recommend the spot enough. If you're willing to do a little walking and the weather is nice, this place is accessible to nearly the entire city. My girlfriend and I walked nearly 50 miles over 5 days because we we felt no need to not walk everywhere. 

Amad was great was well. He contacted me immediately after check in to make sure I did not have any trouble and answered the one question I did have during the stay right away. If something did go wrong, I am confident he would have handled it swiftly and without incident.

Well, we made reservations to Momofuku and plans to go to an event at the convention center and realized it was all maybe 10 minute walk or less from our place. It was perfect! The view laying in the bed at night, seeing the CN Tower, was incredible! Make sure you check in at the front with security, they will yell at you if you try to bypass them.

It was freezing in there and I do not recommend staying there in cold months. Although they turned up the heat (remotely) I think, it was still cold. We turned down our blanket and realized there was no top sheet only a fitted sheet, which is gross! How many people have slept with that comforter on them! Disgusting! There were no extra sheets or blankets. Our romantic night turned into sleeping fully clothed with hats on to stay warm! To top it off I complained that there were no washcloths and was told by them that each guest gets 1 towel! I just wanted to wash my makeup off! In the morning we were woken by housekeeping knocking on the door even though we were granted a late checkout. We tried to savor the night and take a hot shower before we left and SURPRISE no hot water!! Are you kidding me!!!! It was an absolute disaster and we will never stay there again!

14806985,Kathryn,1,"This was a nightmare.   The place itself was nice.  However, the host rented our floor to me (52 year old law professor, 21 year old daughter and 12 year old son) as well as to KIDS who had an all night party which involved many people running up and down the halls, smoking A LOT of pot (my twelve year old got contact high), blaring music, and screaming.  This went on from 7:30 p.m. until 3:00 a.m.  While the host's agents wrote back and stayed in touch, NO ONE showed up to shut down the party, no one called for or sent help, and when I asked for a reimbursement (just on principle) the host failed to respond.  We felt very unsafe.  After a few hours my plan was to leave and just pay for a hotel, however, it was TOO UNSAFE to leave our apartment.  When we left in the early morning, we could not exit the apartment because there was a 3 foot wide, 8 inch high pile of trash blocking our exit.   While my feeling WAS that a good host could unwittingly rent to a bad guest and thus I was willing to consider giving him the benefit of the doubt, the host proved himself to be untrustworthy when a) he failed to respond to my concerns the next day and failed to apologize or offer reimbursement (this wasn't about the money, it was the principle), and b) failed to send help when I said we felt unsafe.",-0.010046296296296312,Negative

-The spray nozzle/hose by the tub faucet leaked water everywhere, which I didn't learn about until a bunch of my stuff got soaked.
-The shower rack was completely rust covered.
-One of the blinds was broken and stuck all the way down.
-The apartment was unbearably hot, but there was a lockbox over the thermostat.

20902086,Danielle,4,"This place was exactly as described and a great unit. It's nicely decorated with plenty of space to spread out (I had two people in my party and we had lots of space). It was nice having the bed and two pull out beds. There were lots of pillows as well. No extra blankets for the pull out couches though, though I had one in my car so we didn't bother asking for any extras.

The check in process was very easy with the lock box. We drove up from Rochester (NY) and there was plenty of street parking, though the price is a bit steep ($4 per hour). There's also a lot across from the property that you can pay to park in for ~$15 per day.

The location is okay. It wasn't immediately close to as many restaurants or other things to do as I was hoping, but it's close enough to other areas that you can walk or Uber to. There's also currently construction going on directly across from the property so there was a bit of noise with that.

The only complaint I have is that the wifi was not working upon our arrival at 4pm. I contacted PaperBox Management through the Airbnb app and while they responded quickly, they asked me to ask the renter in the unit on the third floor to reset the router. I tried, but there were no stairs leading up to the third floor that I could find (only outdoor steps to the main unit, which is not a rental I don't think), plus I wasn't comfortable bothering the other renter. I asked if they could contact them instead, and they did, but the guest was not arriving until around 7pm. I asked if someone from PaperBox could physically come out and reset the router in the meantime but they said it wasn't possible. It was finally fixed around 9pm when the other guest arrived, but I was surprised that there was only one router and it was in a different unit, and that someone couldn't come and reset it without the other renter.

Overall this was a good deal, but I probably would not re-book this unit in the future.",0.1451010101010101,Negative

Parking is always a big concern for me in new places/big cities, and knowing that we had an assigned parking spot was majorly convenient. Although it was quite cold during our stay, as long as we were willing to bundle, everything was in a reasonable walking distance.

Other notes: I love to prepare home-cooked meals when traveling. Kitchen essentials were minimal (ex. No cutting knives for preparing food). Random miscellaneous items not very useful for everyday food prep.

Cleanliness issues with the unit/furniture. Spoke with Amy about this, who was extremely communicative and offered us a refund of our cleaning fee.

25771793,Allison,4,"Over all this condo was in a great location of the city and the parking being included was also a major plus. 
Parking:
The parking space was tight with the car next to us.  We both had to get in and out of the car from the passenger side door and unload the car before we parked in the spot.  
Key pick up:
So this was such a hassle.  Make sure you download the “KeyCafe” app (which I was not told about).  The key was not where I was told it would be and I was not informed about that.  I had to ask the pizza place for their WiFi password so I could call this property group and the worker did not seem very happy about that.  After I called, I was told where it was, we picked it up and all was good after that.  You only get one key and one key fob.  You need to return the key with your code to the pick up location when you depart. 
The condo:
The actual condo was pretty clean other than the bathroom because there was mold around the tub and a cabinet door was missing in the kitchen, but the bed was super comfy.  The bedroom is right above the garbage area outside which was loud in the morning.  
Amenities:
The pool, gym, and locker rooms are on the 22nd floor.  The key fob you get to park needs to be used to get into these rooms.  The fob is “gender specific” so if it is set to male, the females can not get into the pool or locker room and vice versa.
Clean up:
Make sure you follow the directions on how to clean the condo before you leave. I think it’s a little ridiculous we have to pay a cleaning fee when the guests do a handful of the work. 

The condo was decorated very nicely and in a great location.",0.18197478991596638,Negative

There was also a grocery store, liquor store, coffee shops, and restaurants nearby. They generously provided cooking amenities (cooking oil, cookware, salt and pepper). Had a Netflix account but no cable. Checking in was the only problem we encountered and it was an immensely stressful experience. We stay at Airbnbs often and this was out of the ordinary....I was emailed a link which told me the keys to the apartment were in a ""keycafe"" lock box at a pizza shop around the corner. I was told there would be free parking, however upon arrival there was no place to park and no directions as where to park, therefore reaching the ""keycafe"" lock box was not feasible. Upon calling the host to clarify, they informed me that the key was inside the unlocked apartment and that I needed to park in a ""guest spot"" (which were full) to go up to get the key. They informed me that the free parking spot was in the parking garage but I needed the key to access it. So, the only option was to leave my car in front of a ""no parking"" sign with one member of my party in the car. Upon entering the lobby, the security desk would not let me enter the apartment due to the fact that I had no key.

Only thing was that someone was partying under my room till late hours in the night and I could hear them through the vent. Wasn't really bothersome unless they yelled every now & then. The room is also right by the stairs so you can hear footsteps. These are not terrible things in my book, but just something to be aware of :)

17682376,Brian,4,"Overall the experience staying in Toronto is positive. There is a bit downside on how when we arrive at the place,  the toilet bowl was clogged and we can't use it. We tried to call the management and they promised us to get it fixed by the next morning. It wasn't fixed until the following night. 

2nd is the use of the coin laundry. Guest can use the laundry between 5 PM - 10 AM, but the ""housekeeping"", kept his own personal laundry at the machine, therefore any of the guests can't use it. The dryer itself wasn't even emptied by the housekeeper, therefore, guest can't use it as well. 

3rd, on our 2nd night, the auto lock malfunctioned, and a guest frantically rings the bell and made some loud noises at the door, disturbing our sleep. It wasn't a pleasant experience having someone disturb our sleep since it happened at 12:00 midnight.

Nevertheless, the room is as expected. It was nice and clean, parking was easy.",0.13827751196172247,Negative

5073623,Uren,1,"I would not recommend staying here. There were way too many issues with this host:
1) note that the host has outsourced customer service to a 3rd party call center that handles all messages and calls. The call center was extremely unhelpful and often responded that they can’t get in touch with the real host or they will have to ask the question to the host and get back to me. It was extremely frustrating dealing with these middlemen. 
2) the room and bed were dirty when I checked in. When I messaged the “host” about it, they offered to tell me where the clean sheets were so I could replace them myself, and that the cleaners will clean the room the next morning - something that I found unacceptable. I ended up wasting a lot of time dealing with an Airbnb case manager to get a refund for that night. Side note: the cleaners did not clean the next day and came 2 days after I reported the issue.
3) on one of the nights of my stay, the Airbnb room next to mine was having a party - with loud music and making loud noises. I reported this to the host at 10pm (which was the start of their “quiet hours”). The host /call center were extremely unhelpful and didn’t do much to resolve this issue - ultimately they called the cops at 2am (4 hours after I had complained) to break the party up. They essentially disregarded all of their “quiet hours” rules that they have in this listing. 

Overall this was a very bad experience - this is a host that really doesn’t care about providing their guests a decent stay - and I would not recommend this host or this listing.",-0.025632183908045968,Negative

When we went to check in we were handed keys with no instructions on where the room was even located. There was a load of towels/sheets etc... in the washing machine upon arrival. The listing states AC is available, however it fails to mention that in the winter only heat is functioning. Because of this, there is no way to cool it off from whatever it is set at upon arrival which was much too hot for us. Opening the windows leads to no rest because of street noise and even when we did this it failed to cool off. Also, from 11:30pm onward a unit right across the hall had a dog that barked the rest of the night. I went and knocked on the door to get no answer, and then went to the lobby where the receptionists said there was nothing to do. So all in all we got no sleep that night. Upon calling and speaking with someone at Trace and mentioning these things, no sympathy or apology was given. We were told we should have known there wouldn’t be AC because the entire city of Toronto doesn’t have AC option in the winter. Well, that was a complete lie because the hotel we booked for the following night had AC and when we told her that we were told that they looked at us like we were crazy.

The shower is separate from the toilet/sink, so you have to bring your towel around from the shower to the other room. When I asked for more towels, it was a hassle.  The lock to get the towels didn't work, and when I asked one the of the cleaning ladies for a couple of extra towels she asked me why I needed more towels.  One of the towels ripped when I was drying.  Looks like a company owns the whole building and they rent all the rooms on Airbnb.

13714921,Revolution,3,"(Hidden by Airbnb) maps dropped the pin a half  a block up at a building that looked similar but is actually an apartment for mentally ill and recovering addicts and they weren't the friendliest folks to accidentally approach. Not an great first impression.. 
The front door to this apartment is a hollow interior door that's flimsy with no deadbolt and a solid1"" gap under the door. Theres no thermostat or way to control temperature and it was pretty cold in there. It's also extremely paper thin walls made it impossible not to hear every moment of the 3 hour pregame adventures of whichever tenants were the neighbors. 
This is on the second floor of the building and there was a raging party, on the sidewalk and next to the building, both under the bedroom window. Equipped with a DJ that brought his table and speakers and approx (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) people drinking, screaming, singing drunkenly loud. It was literally impossible to fall asleep.

390395,Hannah,3,"Great location! Great communication! Always answered our questions quickly and thoroughly.  A very good local travel guide. So many resources! Sean was very friendly and accommodating when we requested to have an additional guest  stay for one of our nights and for no additional charge. We were free to help ourselves to anything in the apartment. There were always fresh towels in the bathroom. Sean works from home and was so quiet that a lot of times we didn't even know he was home! Everything was clean and clutter free but there was a level of dust/grime that was a bit more than what I'm used to seeing at other airbnbs. There was an interesting smell to the apartment upon first entering that I can only describe as a boy's college dorm when he finds out his parents are stopping in for a surprise visit but we eventually went noseblind to it. There was one evening where we arrived back to the Airbnb at about the same time as Sean and he had been out with friends. He was drunk (which was fine because hosts are more than allowed to have lives outside of  hosting!) But I'm relatively introverted and not interested in drinking so I felt uncomfortable when he was very chatty and throughout our conversation began repeatedly asking if we wanted a drink (from the fridge) and then later if we would want go out to the bar. We said no but he kept insisting. He did eventually stop asking. I don't think there was any ill-will in his asking -- I think he was just trying to be friendly and hospitable.  Overall, our stay with Sean was a positive one. Personally, I wouldn't stay again because I like to keep to myself. But Sean's place is perfect for any extrovert who loves a good night out and is looking to meet new people.",0.2679372294372295,Negative

18405740,Alexis,1,"So we planned this trip for a relaxing anniversary getaway. When we got there from the time it took us to figure out where to park/ the time it took to figure out how to get the fob, park and THEN find the right building where our room was located, about an hour had passed. When we finally got into our room our first impression was that the place looked tidy. When we went into the bedroom we put our things on the bed and noticed about 10-15 hairs and even worse... nail clippings. Literally gagging. We looked around some more and noticed the chair in the bedroom was covered in stains, there was a face and hand print against the window of the bedroom, the kitchen towel had food crusted on it still and the couch was covered in what I’m assuming was dog hair. I messaged the host asking her if she had seen the condo after the cleaning and prior to our arrival and I got no response for hours until I messaged her again complaining of the uncleanliness. She was understanding and was upset the cleaning lady didn’t do a good job but made no effort on her own to fix anything. When we got there after traveling 4 hours, we were forced to do laundry which took us longer to even figure out. Long story short we ended up having to sleep on the bed with just a sheet. We went there expecting to be able to enjoy the whole day and instead had to do chores in a place that should have been cleaned prior. She was understanding but only offered to compensate me with a $33 cleaning fee. I feel like our whole experience was ruined because we were so grossed out with the space. We couldn’t even shower because it was not cleaned either. Overall I’m disappointed she didn’t go there to finish the laundry and make things right when she lived in the same building. I read that this place was dirty from a couple people and I wish I had listened !",0.0987577639751553,Negative

The room was as shown, although the room on the recons floor was quite hot and the bed was very uncomfortable. We were also warned via the standard email to guests that you could “only whisper” inside the house and any noise complaints would result in extra charges. While a bit off putting, this did result in a relatively quiet stay while we were there and we weren’t kept up at night by any other guests. 

Also, the “free parking” is a bit misleading. There are only two spots in the back for upwards of 6 guests at any given time. Both were taken the entire duration of our stay. Luckily we got dropped off so we didn’t have to deal with finding alternative parking as I didn’t see any around.

There were mutliple dents, holes and dings on all of the walls, as well as a film of dust on all of the appliances.

3987246,Julia,2,"The location is great. However, there was some late night family drama that made us feel uncomfortable and involved outside officials in the home. It felt like it was a private home more than a place of hospitality. You can expect to share bathrooms with other visitors. If you have a private room, it doesn’t lock from the outside. It has a very communal living feel. There also wasn’t air conditioning, and opening the window let in noise from other visitors outside late at night. However, the hosts were nice when we talked to them and gave good advice, we were able to come and go as we pleased and the place is affordable.",0.14411764705882354,Negative
3987246,Janita,3,"This home is in a great location for guests attending downtown conferences or interested in a stay close to Toronto's center. For young or on-a-budget travelers with a roommate who are fine with communal-style living, it's a pretty good deal. The shower, for instance, heats up quickly and there are plenty of neatly-wrapped bath towel sets for guests as well as fluffy bathrobes and shower shoes to wear.

But I must share that I would not recommend this Airbnb to the majority of travelers, for the following reasons:

1)	It is more a boarding house than an Airbnb. Most Airbnbs provide Continental breakfast, paper towels/napkins, bottled water and a very welcoming atmosphere. This is a place where many items are rationed and guests are asked to follow detailed rules posted throughout the home and communicated by the owners' live-in manager.

2)	We met at least five different tenants in our time there. In addition, there was at least one young man who came in to get towels and take a shower only; he said he was a good friend of the owners. Lastly, the owners, their teenage son, the manager and her (very nice) husband all live in the home. All were polite but there were a lot of people in this home and faces changed frequently.

3)	At this rate, in comparable cities I've visited, guests can find a private apartment or one half of a townhome where they will experience a greater degree of ""hospitality"" and be made to feel more like valued guests than temporary for-profit tenants who might ""tear up"" the property. In fact, this experience is one reason that I probably will no longer consider an Airbnb that isn't an offer for ""entire home.""",0.21611925708699903,Negative

I actually left my watch at the place, the host was nice enough to arrange for me to get it through an extra key. As far as Hosts go, he went above and beyond and out of his way to accommodate me.

Olya was in top of any question or request I had.  Checking in and out was simple and hassle free.  The unit was quiet both during the day and night, so much so that I slept for 10 hours one night!

17682332,Stella,4,"Pro: This is the only room on the ground floor, very close to door and kitchen, and you’ll pretty much have the bathroom at the basement to yourself, which is super convenient. The management team is quick in responses. We were also very lucky to be able to park the car at the back. Subway is just a few minutes away - great location. 

Con:  This is the only room on the ground floor close to door and kitchen, so you can hear all the talks/footsteps/doors. I read lots of reviews and came prepared with earplugs but still got waken up before 7am by someone rushing above on the hallway/flushing toilets/rushing up and downstairs and finally slammed the door at 7:48am.

4922370,Phan,1,"I have been in Toronto multiple times a year this is the second time I choose to stay with Greg and Elaine. The first stay about a year ago is a blessed. However, this time is not. Greg and Elaine both gone out for vacation and leave the house for Jackie to manage. For some reason, we and Jackie did not get along. She is so rude that she thinks we are her child or something. The first time we argue, I said I already talk to Greg about the problem already, she told me that I’m a liar and do not believe anything I said. (She won’t even let we go up to the room). The second time I feel uncomfortable is on Dec 27, 2019, when I asked to change my bedsheet (since I stay for 13 nights). Jackie refuses to and said that I did not even stay here long enough for the sheet to be changed (Dec 18 to Dec 30 maybe not long enough for that). When I said I been here for more than a week already, she again told me that I’m lying and refuse to change my sheet since the daily task already schedule (what a joke). Fine! She asked me if I want to do it myself. Tbh, this is the first time ever in my whole Airbnb thing that I need to change the sheet my own for my stay. I mean like wth? I already pay for my cleaning service. Another thing is the bathroom that we suppose to share with other guests, it was dirty most of the time and we have to clean it ourselves like twice in the whole stay. I did mention it to Jackie on the last day and hope that they would fix the situation soon since it is very unprofessional for a host to be like that.  Well, this stay is not doing very well for me. I used to recommend I friend to stay here but not anymore. I love the house, I love Greg and Elaine but maybe this is not worth anymore for the headache I have to deal with.

The WiFi wasn't the greatest at times, it did lag a lot but not a major issue since most of your time should be spent out of the house.

This is a crash pad: 8 rooms of guests (16 people approx for 2 bathrooms)
Paper thin walls (can hear everything)
Bed is very plastic sounding when rolling over
Parking: if you get a spot in back (only 2) it is good. If you don’t, you’re SOL
Worst pillows I’ve ever had in my life
Very strict rules
Someone rang the doorbell for 10 mins straight at midnight. When messaged the host about it, they blew us off like we didn’t matter. 
Right on a noisy street; no central air or air flow (no fan) so had to have window open and heard loud street noise all night. 

Pros:
Location close to restaurants and coffee shops. 
Clean and bathrooms well stocked
Across the street from a free running track that was very nice

The space is a bit limited - it would be nice if there were more room to store luggage - but we made do with the closet, and the useful desk.

9975236,Josephine,4,"Great location! You have a nice view - beware Lake Ontario and can tower are only mostly visible from one part of the window, the rest faces other high rise condos. 

The space itself was okay - it definitely could’ve been tidier. The space was obviously lived in and hadn’t been truly deep cleaned in a while which was a little sad. I was really hoping for it to be perfect! There was a lot of dust/hair/stuff on the ceiling to floor windowsills (gorgeous windows though). The bathroom was similar and the sink had like stains from water/where it had been turned or something that was super noticeable since the sink is white! 

Jason was super communicative and a convenient host otherwise though. The check in process was super easy and he usually responded to messages/any needs quickly!

I will say, we booked last minute so maybe that had something to do with the apartment not being fully clean, but if it’s listed as available then it should be in the right condition to rent out OR it should be communicated that the space isn’t clean for some reason or something.

The reasons I rated this place 4 stars were:
1) While the location is awesome, attaining the parking permit was difficult. The Toronto City website didn’t work on my phone and constantly froze even on a computer. And after jumping through all the hoops to print, it ended up costing us $17 for a 48hr permit.

Be mindful of your receipt as mine was sent in Euros instead of CAD or US dollars- the cost appeared less than it really was. For that price we would have rather stayed at a hotel in a more central location with fresh linens.  The condo is at LEAST a 25 minute walk to core shopping/ restaurants. The walls are dirty, bathroom cabinets were dirty. And after paying for the room you then get these odd check in instructions sent to you indicating not to talk to the concierge, and if anyone asks tell them you are visiting a friend, etc... We are grown adults who are legitimately paying to stay here. If your condo frowns at Air BNB then you should NOT have one! Guests should not be made to feel like they are sneaking around.  On top of that the main AirBNB customer service is rude and useless.  Jessica didn’t even begin responding to messages until less than 24 hours of our arrival time.

It would have been nice to have some extra towels (we had 4 small towels for 4 people), top sheets, additional linens, and bath mats. There are no curtains of any kind on the large living room windows. The sun in the afternoon is very intense and makes it difficult to sit in the main room.

Anytime I was coming or going either she or her husband would offer me some coffee or tea or something to eat. Any question that I had about how to get around they would answer. She is also a lovely person to chat with and she has the kindest soul. The area is actually very central to a lot of areas such as The Distillery District and downtown. Very easy to navigate around the area. I highly recommend staying here if you are taking a vacation to Toronto. The bedroom was sparkling clean and spacious.

We even had to get changed in the bathroom. We reached out and was told that the quickest date to get it fixed was the day of our check out. We weren’t sure if this was a persistent issue since if the shades were to be broken by the previous guests and the owner didn’t know about this, there would be broken shade parts remaining on the floor. Instead, there weren’t any broken shade/curtain parts remaining. Another complaint we had was the neighbor playing loud music at night, which was quite annoying.

4198453,Natasha,4,"We stayed at Quinn and Chris’s place for three nights this summer, and here is the list of of pros and cons as they appeared to me. 

Pros: 1.Good location. Most of the places were an easy Uber/Lyft ride away. And we had a very easy and pleasant walk to Kensington market. The neighborhood is lovely too and safe to walk around at night. 
2. Quinn and Chris were very helpful in accommodating our sudden need for a car parking spot. They printed out the permit and had it ready for us almost as soon as we asked. I also found them easier to reach through text messages than over the airbnb app.
3. The space itself is large and roomy though the bathroom is tiny. The kitchen serves well for quick and easy breakfast needs and it was stocked with staples such as butter/sugar/tea/ coffee/ necessary spices and so on. 
Cons: 1. The apartment listing mentions that the ceiling is low and might be a challenge for people who are 6’2 and over. However my husband who is a shade under 6ft had to continuously walk with his head bent in the hallway. Plus with the bathroom being small and the ceiling being low , the light there was almost at his temple. And after three days of walking with head tilted sideways he was thoroughly fed up. 
2. Since this is a basement apartment sounds do carry quite a bit from upstairs. 
3. The bedsheets and towels were all cleaned and washed, but bore mild stains from prior usage.",0.24258503401360548,Negative

It is well equipped for couples or one person, who look for a good place to rest, get a good shower, have a good sleep and eat some easy food before go out. Is really close to the university of Toronto, Casa loma, Yorkville (best spot in town) and Kensington area but you have to walk or Uber your way.

- Amazing location close to everything

Cons:
- non responsive via text, must call
- elevators took 10+ min 
- never fixed missing blinds despite sending pics
- too much light
- rude front desk worker (bigger dude with short dark hair)
- no privacy from neighbors as you can hat everything and can see each other when they are outside on their patio
- washing machine wouldn’t work half the time 
- a bunch of stuff leftover from past guests..(bud light and wine in the freezer)

The place is extremely small as compared to the description given. it smells of marijuana all over and no matter if you open the window the smell belongs there! entire apartment is utmost shabby place as if given to a homeless person. Lets start from bathroom, broken bath tub with no bathroom accessories, dirty stinky towels as if hung and used for months. Shampoo botel filled with water!!no conditioner/lotion/tissue. Toilet is dirty and the used towel paper are sitting there, utmost small but could adjust if clean which is absolutely missing. Cleanliness is maintained at negative standard. Next in line is kitchen where dustbin is overflowing with empty soda cans and glasses, Pullout sofa is like 50 years old at least and if you plan to sleep there be ready to visit your Orthopedician, nude homosexual content at display which is highly traumatizing for young kids, half used cigars, emty soda can and blood stained antelope horns..yes! I am posting pictures to save your time and money. Bedroom is no different, with no linen, bedsheets or pillow cover. Here, you see utmost negligence of the host and you wonder that this kind of people are still functional. Gay content magazines and images kept right at front. This apartment is the dirtiest place I have ever seen in any of trips world wide and trust me I have traveled a lot including third world countries.

Pros:
- Good location
- Responsive host
- Essentials provided
- Clean apartment
- Nice view
- private parking included in price 
- comfortable bed
- extra linens provided

Improvements
- Make check in a bit smoother. Concierge couldn’t be aware of the Airbnb so you’ll have to have hide the fact
- Sofa bed was not as comfortable as we thought it would be
- shower could use more pressure
- one of the bathroom doors doesn’t quite lock",0.36515151515151517,Negative
26656133,Amanda,5,"This place is very easy to navigate with the instructions Alper has provided for you. We ran into some unexpected difficulties while checking in with the door being locked, but Alper and his cleaner were able to be in contact and help us with what we needed within 20 minutes which is great. Free parking was definitely a plus like the other reviews have written and it was right under the building, so you don’t have to walk far for it. We were able to find the parking space very easily, but please be very careful in the parking garage because the corners are narrow and it’s a small unit to drive through. Other than that, the stay was much better than I expected. The view from the apartment was beautiful and the balcony was very nice. It felt very home-like with the comfortable bed/blankets and was overall very cleanly. Your offered a good amount of bathroom needs such as towels and toiletry products. Your offered a wide variety of spices and coffee which we didn’t use but is definitely a plus for others who enjoy that. You definitely won’t be disappointed when you stay in this condo. It was a great price for what you’re provided with. Thank you again, Alper!",0.2367434715821813,Negative

38292781,Oronde,4,Great location.  I stayed there for 1 night and parking was a royal PIA.  I would not suggest this location if you have a vehicle since there are only 2 parking spaces and multiple travelers in the building.  Chances of you getting a spot are a real gamble.  I completely lost. If you are visiting from outside Canada the phone pay app may not be the best option because I believe they take an initial 20-25 dollar deposit out upon first use.  You will need to keep running back to the meter to top it up.  The one pay lot is a bit of a walk so not the most convenient if you have a vehicle.

38292781,Diana,1,"I beg you, DO NOT deal with any listings from this host & the management company, Paperbox.

Absolute disaster of a stay...
Hair on the shower wall
GIANT hair cluster in shower drain.
Hair appliance in bedroom thrown around carelessly
Kitchen sink drain dirty & full of food debris.
General uncleanliness of the kitchen- dishes from previous guest still out, dirty water in tea kettle, wet rag on counter, cleaning soaps left on counter, crumbs on toaster.

Check in instructions sent 3.5 hours AFTER check in time; paperbox/host did not notice until I had to call for the lock box code / check in instructions.

Paperbox/host claimed cleaner came by and cleaned the apartment when confronted with the dirtiness of the unit & tried to tell me that it was clean, when I have the text from them saying that the cleaner was not able to get into the apartment to clean.  Paperbox/host did not remedy the situation & had to stay in the filth of a unit.  I have not heard from them in regards of a refund.  They became unresponsive & had to get Airbnb involved.

Photos taken are misleading - 
No decorations in bedroom.
No mirror in bathroom.
No sunlight shining in from windows as the pictures depict because it is in between two buildings and the fact that it is a basement apartment.

Parking that is included is a gamble because it is dedicated to you, but on a first come first serve basis with all the other airbnb guests in the rest of the building.

What a poor excuse for a host / management company to be part of the hospitality industry.  Do yourself a favor and find another airbnb & if none are available for your dates, get a hotel and save yourself the hassle and migrant from hell.",-0.029385964912280703,Negative

20010119,Suzanne,5,"Cozy is the word for it — this room is small. But since I didn’t need it for practicing my floor routine, it was quite comfortable. The wifi is good, there is a power strip for computing and charging, and you have your own entrance. I didn’t use them, but there is also a dresser and a TV. Hooks for even heavy winter coats are in the room, along with a mat for shoes and complimentary slippers to use. There is a kitchenette available, with a kettle for boiling water ready to go. While the bathroom is shared, I never noticed anyone else using it (great water pressure, too!). It is very clean, and I found the bed to be very comfortable (I prefer a firm mattress). The pillows have a firm side and a soft side, to appeal to everyone. There are some drawbacks: the path along the side of the house to your private entrance isn’t all well lit (I used my phone flashlight) and the gate catch at the top is a little tricky from the outside. You can’t flush toilet paper, which may put off anyone who has never been outside the US and Canada, but won’t phase world travelers. The parking is by neighbourhood permit, so it’s best to go to the Toronto City Hall site and purchase a temporary permit (24-hr, 48-hr, or one week), and print the permit off at home before you come. It’s $11CDN, as opposed to the $50 ticket you get if you’re parked after midnight without one. I didn’t know that and it was a little inconvenient to get it done once there. The location is excellent, about a 3-4-minute walk to College Street (where you could also park), where there are some great restaurants. I was in town for an event at the Mod Club Theatre, and I was so glad I had a brief walk back to my cozy room and not a drive back to Buffalo at the end of the night.

The apt needs to be fixed/ remodeled a bit more - furniture is old and things need to be fixed like light bulbs, taps, lamps, etc - but it’s EXTREMELY comfy and cozy. Also keep in mind Airbnb is NOT allowed in this building so you kinda have to “lay low” from concierge. Also The windows are NOT sound proof which means there is SIGNIFICANT traffic noise that will affect your sleeping if you’re a light sleeper (right on the highway) - which is why I didn’t give this place a 5 star.

I was a bit worried with the whole parking thing, as i had drove my car to Toronto. However, Elaine has great information regarding the cheap private parking lot. Which was super hassle free once parked. When i had a hard time finding it, she was very patient with directing me on the phone while at work too.

As far as the noise, I expected it to get a bit noisy due to the fact that multiple people live/sleep in the space. All with different sleep / wake times. The noise isn’t obnoxious though, so it wasn’t an issue for me. Falling asleep at night was really easy and waking up as an early riser was also noise free. I hardly noticed there were two other people in my space. 

Anyways, AMAZING place to stay. It’s super cheap and worth it! This location helped me spend my money on more amazing things for the few days I was there, instead of spending hundreds on a hotel/Airbnb.",0.2448924731182796,Negative

21900543,Lynda,3,"Robby was very helpful and quick to respond to all of our communications with him. His place is fresh and modern and in a great location, but we found that we wanted to like it more than we did. For us, it had one major problem and several little ones. The big problem was the bed itself: it was extremely hard (not firm) and so uncomfortable that my friend and I were both waking up frequently in the night with aching backs and hip pain, taking ibuprofen to try to help. It felt like we were camping on the ground with just a thin sleeping pad. Not having a good night's sleep made it tough to be excited about seeing the sights in Toronto.

The little inconveniences included no in-suite coffee, we couldn't find hand towels, and we couldn't get anything on the TV. This was our first experience where you get the whole place (as opposed to a suite in someone's house) and it may be typical for this type of rental, but we really missed  these common hotel amenities. The place was top clean, but not super clean. In the bathroom, for example, the sink and toilet bowl were both clean enough, but the baseboards, base of the toilet, outlets - really any other surface - was covered with a pretty good layer of dust.

There were also some inconveniences outside of the host's control that are just good to be aware of. Parking costs about $25 a day and you have to go renew the parking in the morning and at night. Access to parking required going outside the building and down through a horribly disgusting and convoluted stairwell. Also, the fire alarm went off in the middle of the night and we had no idea what it was.  We texted Robby right away and he was great to get back to us quickly. Talking to another tenant the next day, we learned that this is a frequent occurrence, so future guests might just want to know of the possibility.",0.09419156551509492,Negative

They also have a washer and dryer that is available for doing laundry. The only drawback I could think of was that the bed was only a full size, so if you are a larger person it might make for a tight squeeze the way the bed is set up in the corner.

Ben was a great host and was very quick with response, the parking helped immensely as you didn’t have to find parking in the city, and the security at the front desk made you feel safe.

There was a mini fridge, kettle (with free coffee and tea), washer/dryer, and a microwave. He even provided towels which was amazing.

Andrew also gave me the option of remotely adjusting the temperature which was amazing. Toronto basements can be pretty cold in the winter/fall so that was a much appreciated luxury. All-in-all I give this place a 4.5-5 out 5 for me. 

One word of warning. It can be the case in Toronto homes that sound travels so if you’re a sensitive sleeper maybe have some earplugs. This is the perfect spot to drop your things, get some rest and then head out and explore the rest of Toronto.

There is a Rabba foods open 24/7 right at the corner of where you will be staying (only 2 blocks away) just in case you need to buy anything or pay a visit to the Tim Hortons inside to get a pastry or some coffee (they are open from 7am-11pm if I’m not mistaken.) from the bus stop right in front of the Rabba/Tim Hortons you can take the 510 all the way to downtown where the CN Tower is, or St. Lawrence Market (again, same price as you pay from the airport to the Air BnB, what a deal!). Now onto the actual room, it’s a quiet place, very clean, Andrey had a working coffee machine and sugar there, even some cream for you to get your morning caffeine fix. The bed was comfortable, all of the plugs worked, we didn’t watch much TV, but it was nice to put on the local news each morning while we were getting ready. The Radiator in the room keeps it real warm in the winter, and there is a washing machine and a dryer in the next room that you can use if you are staying a few days (but have your coins ready, it’s $1.50 CAD to wash, and $1.75 CAD to dry, really worth it for a large load of laundry). Now I’m sure I mentioned it was clean, but again I must say it was clean, there were nice soft bath towels and hand towels to use and to top it off, there was even shampoo and bars of soap (Dove and Irish Spring). There was even a large bowl of candy just in case you need a sugar pick me up which was really nice. The WiFi was fast, there is no ironing board, but in the winter all you need to do is plug in the iron that is there and give it a quick pass since you will be all covered up with your coats, scarves, and gloves (layer up in the winter, even your socks, you don’t want to freeze). I’ve rambled on enough, Andrey was a gentleman, a professional, and above all treats you like a friend.

Granted, the place is small and is a sofa bed but I found it fine and perfect for solo travelers.

The studio is trimmed-out nicely on the inside with granite countertops, nice fixtures & appliances, and pretty decor.
     The biggest positive regarding Rosie’s place is the location. It’s within minutes of Toronto’s downtown, Old Toronto, and most of the main places in the city to visit...
     The biggest opportunity would be the bathroom storage space. There’s no shelving or counter-space  on which to place your toiletries or other items. Not a huge deal, but you’ll have to improvise a little here. Also, yes the bed isn’t the most comfortable being a couch pull-out... but, it does the job.

The condo furnishings could use an upgrade; the kitchen table stools, couch and chair - while newish - are cheap and uncomfortable.

Black mold and extreme condensation in the fridge, dirty tub, towels were stained and the bathroom fan would not turn off, was loud and unfortunately kept me up for 2 nights. There were stains on the kitchen table and the floor infront of the fridge was really dirty - like someone had dropped blobs of honey. The bedroom light needed to be plugged in and unplugged to to work. You can't sit on the couch. It's a pull out and has bucket seats - you need to sit on cushion. I sat on kitchen chairs the whole time. The hosts are responsive but never once came to fix it. I had to continually send pictures to prove what was happening. After all that they only refunded me $50. The bed is comfortable, there is a starbucks right downstairs, a great LCBO down the street , check in is easy, and the kitchen is stocked for anything you may need for a long stay.

19202117,Daniel,4,"I think one of the best things about this place is that it is centrally located downtown. You are only a few minutes from Osgoode Station (which is a stop on the subway system), you are close to the main train station (Union Station) and you are only a few blocks away from Queen Street West, which has the streetcars, and has a lot of great restaurants and shops (record shops, shopping, etc.). Also, once you come out of the building there is a 24-hour shop around the corner where you can get basics (water, milk, eggs, cheese, cold cuts, etc.) at any time of the day or night. The bed is comfortable, and the shower has great water pressure and lots of hot water. You are about 16 stories up, so you'll be somewhat isolated from the street-level noise, although this is a bit city and you are downtown, so you'll get some noise. There is a coffee maker and an electric kettle in the kitchen, which was nice for early morning coffee. This is not a luxury condo, but it is a good apartment where you can stay and have access to all things downtown. One point I feel I have to mention is that we were told not to use the front door of the building, and to walk in through the back (through the parking garage). I think if you come by car, this is probably no big deal, because you're going to park in the garage anyway, but we came in by train and were on foot and, had we known we couldn't use the front door, we would have rented elsewhere. But other than that, we had no major objections.",0.19265350877192985,Negative

The apartment is centrally located to restaurants, shops, cafes, supermarket, buses, street cars.  You can walk to a lot of attractions, which is great, especially in the evening when it's not so hot. The only thing I would like to note is it might get loud because of the proximity to a busy highway.  Especially at night, when it's not so busy, cars/motorcycles speed up and make a lot of noise.  It did not bother me so much, but my husband woke up at night several times because of it.
